# Questions

- Why/when is one type of imaging used instead of a another?
- What can a researcher do with a batch of images? How have images been used in ophthalmic research before?


# Ocular Imaging Methods

The synthetic retinal images used in this workshop are derived from two noninvasive ocular imaging modalities: fundus photography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). These imaging techniques can be used in isolation for a patient, but it's also effective to combine them for a better diagnostic and monitoring tool. For example, OCT used with fundus photography is effective for glaucoma screening (Mishra, Tripathy).

### Fundus photography

Fundus photography shows the retina, optic nerve head, macula, retinal blood vessels, choroid, and vitreous. It is a diagnostic tool for conditions like diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinopathy of prematurity. (Mishra, Tripathy)

To capture an image of the retina, the back of the eye must be illuminated. Fundus photography uses a narrow beam of light through the pupil that reflects off the back of the eye to illuminate the retina.

### Optical Coherence Tomography
OCT is a noninvasive imaging modality that takes cross-sectional photos of the retina and optic nerve. Since the photos shows each layer of the retina, an ophthalmologist can determine where the swelling or damage to the retina is, informing with the diagnosis. (https://www.aao.org/eye-health/treatments/what-is-optical-coherence-tomography)

OCT can help with the diagnosis and detection of these common opthalmic conditions (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/optical-coherence-tomography):
- age-related Macular Degenerations
- glaucoma
- macular edema
- diabetic retinopathy
- optic nerve disorders

OCT is one of the primary imaging modalities used in ocular clinial care and research. OCT is considered to be, "one of the most important imaging modalities in clinical practice for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with retinal disease, as well as a source for outcome measurements in clinical trials." (Muller et al.)

Muller et al. offers the following characteristics of OCT that make it a popular tool for research and clinicare care include:

- It is noninvasive. OCT is a scan and does not require surgical intervention.
- It is quick. OCT can be completed in a few minutes.
- It is reproducible (although variations between hardware and software exist so reporducibility is constrained to the same equipment)
- Can distinguish between layers of the retina, allowing for differentiation between conditions that affect the outer retina, compared to the inner retina.
- It can be used alongside other imaging formats to diagnose and monitor some of the most prevalent ophthalmic conditions including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy
- It is detailed. OCT produces a 3-dimensional view of each retinal layer, picking up subtle changes that wouldn't be detected in other imaging formats.

Since OCT is noninvase and quick, it's feasible to do routine imaging, allowing a researcher or clinician to have a longitudinal view of a patient's disease progression or therapeutic intervention over time. 

# Helpful Terminology

| Abbreviation | Meaning |
---------------|---------
| AMD | Age-related Macular Degeneration
| OCT | Optical coherence tomography 
| OCT-A | Optical coherence tomography angiography


# Other common ocular imaging technologies include:

- Fluorescein Angiography
    - Imaging modality for seeing the blood vessels in the back of the eye.
    - Requires dilation of the pupil and injection of a flourescent dye, making it a more invasive method, although still quick (30 minutes) and the preferred method for monitoring retinal circulation and imaging the choroid. (https://eyewiki.aao.org/Fluorescein_Angiography)

- Optical Coherence Tomography - Angiography (OCT-A)
    - A newer, noninvasive method to image retinal circulation and the choroid. Fluorescein angiography requieres dye injection, but OCT-A uses repeated imaging to indicate flow rate between vessels. (https://eyewiki.aao.org/Optical_Coherence_Tomography_Angiography)

Ocular terminology is not fully standardized in clinical systems. 
 
As discussed in Cai et al. (2023), terminology coverage of general eye examination concepts is incomplete. Additionally, it is unclear if the standard terminology that does exist is used consistently in systems of record for clinical ocular data. If terminology is not used consistently, mapping to a standardized terminology would have to occur after data are extracted for research. Discussions with SMEs indicated that increasing awareness of ocular terminology would be beneficial in promoting use of standardized terminology. 
 
The SNOMED Eye Care Clinical Reference Group is actively working on improving SNOMED’s support for ocular terminology as of late 2023 (and we recognize that this workgroup involves members of the NEI team that MITRE is supporting). Other potentially relevant terminology systems include ICD-10 for diagnoses, LOINC for identifying tests, and RxNorm for identifying medications. 
 
Imaging is important for ocular research and there are opportunities to better integrate imaging with other systems using FHIR. 
 
Discussions with SMEs indicated that imaging is generally important in ocular research, and that technical restrictions in imaging devices and software can impede researchers. The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard is typically used alongside FHIR to support interoperability in modern systems, but this is not widely adopted by ocular imaging device vendors. Additionally, the software used in ocular imaging systems often does not communicate with the EHR, leading to fragmented ocular data storage. 
 
One of the key objectives of the Eyes on FHIR IG is to support communication between EHRs and ocular imaging systems, and this capability was tested in the September 2021 Connectathon described above. In theory, FHIR can be used to allow an imaging system to retrieve data from an EHR, and to send data back to that EHR for storage alongside the rest of the patient’s medical record. 
 
Note that the DICOM Working Group 9 (WG-09): Ophthalmology aims to increase adoption and implementation of DICOM standards through vendor education and demonstration.
