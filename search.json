    "text": "The FHIR specification is under active development. The latest version, R5, was officially published in March 2023. Major updates to the FHIR specification are typically published every few years, and minor updates are published more frequently.\nMajor updates to FHIR can have breaking changes, but typically these changes only occur in areas of the specification that are not fully mature. FHIR uses a maturity model that describes “the level of stability and implementation readiness associated with different aspects of the specification.”\nFor example, the Patient resource was assigned a “normative” maturity level in the R4 release of FHIR. This means that starting in the R4 release, the content of the Patient resource\nOther resources, like NutritionProduct have a much lower maturity level even in the R5 release. These resources are likely to experience more significant changes – including breaking changes – in subsequent releases of FHIR."

For example, we would link to the version-independent URL when generally referencing the Patient resource (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html), but would link to the R4 URL when stating that Patient achieved “normative” maturity in R4 ((https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html)).

    "text": "1 CDMs and FHIR\nCDMs and FHIR are both important parts of the health research data ecosystem, but differ in key ways:\n\nPurpose and scope\n\nCDMs: Provide a consistent structure for storing and querying health data to faciliate research.\nFHIR: Enable interoperability between health IT systems (which can included research-related systems).\n\n\n\nStructure\n\nCDMs: Typically, CDMs consist of a standardized set of relational database tables, with columns for each data element. CDMs also typically define standardized terminology for representing concepts.\nFHIR: FHIR defines resources for each type of data, which can be extended to add additional data elements as needed for a given use case. Resources have a nested structure (like a multi-level outline) rather than a tabular structure (like a spreadsheet). The base FHIR specification does have strict terminology constraints, though these can be added for a specific use case in an Implementation Guide.\n\n\n\nImplementation\n\nCDMs: Typically implemented as a database within a research data warehouse. When CDMs are used as part of a research data network, additional mechanisms may be implemented for sharing data across the network (Weeks and Pardee, n.d.).\nFHIR: Typically implemented as an API within a health IT system like an EHR, though research-specific databases may also implement FHIR (e.g., Kids First).\n\nBecause of these differences, FHIR does not obviate existing CDMs and health data networks. However, FHIR can be used in conjunction with CDMs. For example:\n\nPopulating a CDM: FHIR can be used as part of the process for populating a CDM. Typically, data are extracted from EHRs and other clinical or billing systems, transformed into the CDM’s format, and then loaded into the CDM database. (Note that this type of process is generally referred to as ETL for Extract, Transform, Load.) FHIR can be used as the input into an ETL process, which may allow for ETL logic that is more portable across institutions and EHR installations.\nMapping between CDMs: The Common Data Models Harmonization IG uses FHIR to map and translate between PCORNet, i2b2, OMOP, and Sentinel (all described below).\nPortable phenotypes: FHIR and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) were used by Brandt et al. (2022) to create phenotypes for cohort definitions. These were translated to run against the OMOP CDM. Theoretically, institutions that do not have OMOP research databases could use FHIR and CQL directly to identify cases and non-cases."

    "text": "2 Notable CDMs\nIf you are not familiar with CMS, below are some notable CDMs used in the US:\n\nOMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership)\nSentinel\nPCORnet (Patient-Centered Outcomes Researcher Network)\ni2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside)\n\n\n2.1 OMOP\nOMOP was originally created in 2007 by the FDA and other partners to study the effects of medical products.(Weeks and Pardee, n.d.) It is now managed by the OHDSI (Observational Health Data Science and Informatics).\nOMOP is an:\n\nopen community data standard, designed to standardize the structure and content of observational data and to enable efficient analyses that can produce reliable evidence.\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nOMOP uses OHDSI standardized vocabularies. The OHDSI standardized vocabularies establish a single standard concept for each clinical entity. When data is converted into OMOP, the source concept is mapped to the corresponding standard concept. This allows researchers to interpret and use clinical entities from different organizations.(OHDSI, n.d.)\n\n\n2.2 Sentinel\nSentinel is a CDM designed to monitor whether FDA-regulated medical products cause unexpected adverse reactions.\nAlthough FDA-regulated products undergo clinical testing before approval, the testing may miss adverse reactions. This is because the test population may not fully represnt the population that uses the product. To detect and assess adverse events after approval, the FDA created Sentinel in 2007. See here for more information about the Sentinel data network.\n\n\n\nDiagram showing the structure of the Sentinel CDM. From &lt;https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/methods-data-tools/sentinel-common-data-model&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n2.3 PCORnet\nThe Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed PCORnet to make clinical research more streamlined, representative, and efficient. PCORnet data is largely drawn from EHRs, as well as some patient-reported and payor data. The PCORnet includes data from 66 million patients that researchers can use for observational studies. PCORnet launched in 2014 (Fleurence et al. 2014).\n\n\n\nDiagram showing the structure of the PCORnet CDM v6.1. From “PCORnet Common Data Model (CDM) Specification, Version 6.1” (2023).\n\n\n\n\n2.4 i2b2\nDeveloped in 2004 by Partners HealthCare and Harvard Medical School, i2b2 is an open-source research data application framework that “provides clinical and translational investigators with the tools necessary to integrate medical record and clinical research in the genomics age.” (n.d.a)\ni2b2 is structured differently from the other CDMs discussed here: rather than having separate data tables for each type of data (e.g., procedures and diagnoses are stored in different database tables, each with a different set of columns), i2b2 uses the same set of tables for all data types. i2b2 refers to this as the “star schema” (see diagram below). i2b2 describes this as follows:\n\nInstead of separate tables for diagnoses, medications, and other data types, all patient observations are stored in a single “fact” table. A separate ontology describes the different codes that are placed in this fact table. As a result, institutions can use their own local codes, without having to map to common code sets. Furthermore, institutions can easily add new types of data to i2b2 and tranSMART just by extending the ontology. No changes to the database or software are needed. This enables software developers to build query, analysis, and visualization tools that are generalizable to different types of data and future-proof since the i2b2 CDM can remain stable over time.\n\n\n\n\nDiagram showing the i2b2 “star schema”, from  (n.d.b)."

Some of the key considerations specifically for research include:\n\nAre all the necessary data elements included in the resources profiled in the IG? Determining\nAre the constraints defined in the IG appropriate for the relevant research use cases?\n\nAre necessary data elements marked as required or marked as MustSupport? This means that conforming FHIR servers should provide the data elements if they are available.\nAre there any required data elements that are problematic from a research perspective? (E.g., requiring a patient’s name for research on deidentified data.)\n\nAre there terminology bindings, and are they sufficiently strong to ensure consistent output?\n\nNote that unless a terminology binding is set at the “required” level, FHIR servers may still return concepts that are not in the bound ValueSet.\nThis is especially relevant for using FHIR across different systems or institutions, which may use different terminology. It may be necessary to map to a single set of concepts, either as part of the FHIR implementation or during data analysis.\n\nIs the IG implemented on the relevant FHIR servers you wish to get data from?

    "section": "2 Common API requests for research",
    "text": "2 Common API requests for research\nResearchers will typically be reading data from a FHIR server rather than modifying data on the FHIR server. Requests to read data for research purposes will typically be one of the following:\n\nGetting instances of resources for a specific patient\nGetting all patients that meet a certain set of criteria\n\nExamples of API requests for these use cases are described below. For additional information on FHIR’s search capabilities, please see the Search page in the FHIR specification.\n\n2.1 Getting instances of resources for a specific patient\nThe example above (GET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/591702) shows how to get the instance of Patient for the patient with the ID 591702.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking requests to a FHIR server\n\n\n\nBecause FHIR’s RESTful interface uses standard HTTP requests, it is possible to make GET requests by pasting a URL like https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/591702into your browser’s address bar (omit the GET when using your browser, as loading web pages uses GET by default).\nHowever, it may be helpful to use an API testing tool like Postman or Hoppscotch when constructing FHIR searches for testing, or viewing longer responses. Note that caution should be used when loading real patient data with FHIR via third-party tools. The FHIR search examples in this module use synthetic data so this is not a concern here.\nYou can also use Python or another scripting language to make FHIR API requests and parse the responses. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to do this with Python.\n\n\nIt is possible to get resources related to this patient as well. For example, to get all the Observation resources associated with patient 591702, make the following request:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient?_id=591702&_revinclude=Observation:patient\nNote that rather than including the ID as part of the URL like in GET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient/591702, this request uses the _id parameter. This is necessary because we need to use the search interaction rather than the read interaction3 to retrieve multiple instances at once.\nThis request also uses the _revinclude parameter, which tells the FHIR server to follow the “reverse link” to identify instances of Observation where the reference in Observation.patient refers to one of the instances of Patient returned by the search.\nThe response to a search interaction is an instance of the Bundle resource, which contains the instances of the Patient and Observation resources returned by the server in response to the search. More information on Bundle can be found in Key FHIR Resources.\nDepending on your query, the response may be too large for the sever to easily return all at once. In this case, the server may employ paging to split up the response. If it does, the response will include an entry in the link element that indicate the URL that provides the relation=\"next\" page. To retrieve all the results, you will need to issue a GET request to the next URLs on each page of results. The last page of results will not have a next URL populated.\n\nMultiple types of resources\nThe same approach can be used to get multiple types of resources at once. The query below will include both Observation and Condition instances for the specified patient using multiple _revinclude parameters:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient?_id=591702&_revinclude=Observation:patient&_revinclude=Condition:patient\n\n\nGet instances of a resource without including Patient\nIf you want to get just the instances of a resource like Observation for a patient, without including the instance of Patient, the following approach can be used:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Observation?patient=591702\nThis instructs the server to return instances of Observation where Observation.patient=591702.\n\n\n\n2.2 Getting all patients that meet specified criteria\nFHIR’s search interaction does not allow for the same degree of filtering logic as a SQL-style query in a relational database. However, it does include some ability to filter with AND/OR logic, or by other criteria. Below are a few examples of this functionality.\nTo get all the patients who have an Observation observation with a specific value of Observation.code, make the following request:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Patient?_has:Observation:patient:code=http://loinc.org|718-7\nThis requests all instances of Patient that are associated with an instance of Observation via Observation.patient, and have Observation.code=http://loinc.org|718-7 via reverse chaining. (718-7 is the LOINC for “Hemoglobin [Mass/volume] in Blood”.)\nIf you want the instances of Observation along with Patient, you can use this request instead:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Observation?code=http://loinc.org|718-7&_include=Observation:patient\nThe _include parameter tells the server to return instances of Observation where code=http://loinc.org|718-7, and then to follow the reference in Observation.patient and include the referenced instances as well.\nIt is possible to perform more complex selection and filtering operations via the FHIR search API. For example, to get the subset of these observations with hemoglobin values &gt; 20, make this request:\nGET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/Observation?code=http://loinc.org|718-7&_has:Observation&value-quantity=gt20\nThe parameter value-quantity=gt20 tells the server to take the subset of the selected Observation instances with Observation.valueQuantity greater than (gt) 20. Care should be used when analyzing the response to ensure Observation.valueQuantity.units is consistent.\nA number of other logic and filtering capabilities are described in detail on in a section on the Search page in the FHIR specification."

The capability interaction is of the form:\nGET [base]/metadata\nThis request will return an instance of a resource called a CapabilityStatement that defines the behaviors supported by the server.\nInstances of CapabilityStatement are often extremely long – the response from GET https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4/metadata is more than 25,000 lines of JSON. Therefore, if you wish to use the capabilities interaction to discover server capabilities, you will likely need to write a script to assist with parsing the response.

    "text": "2 The HL7 FHIR community\nThe HL7 FHIR community consists of developers, maintainers, and implementers who engage with the FHIR specification. Community-members work in many environments including:\n\nClinical settings\nHealth-focused companies and non-profits\nLocal, state, and federal health agencies\n\nBecause FHIR is an open-source specification, most of HL7’s FHIR work is done publicly, and anyone can participate. The FHIR community also develops many FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) with the same public approach.\nThis openness makes members of the community accessible to implementers and developers who want to:\n\nAsk questions.\nFollow the progress of work.\nContribute to the work through the channels described below.\n\n\n2.1 HL7 Work Groups\nHL7 specifications and many FHIR Implementation Guides are developed as HL7 Projects. HL7 Projects are efforts that are developed under the guidance of one or more HL7 Work Groups.\nWork Groups are:\n\n…the bodies within HL7 that take on responsibility for developing and maintaining standards. They are where the “work” of HL7 gets done. HL7 has many work groups covering the spectrum of the healthcare space. All work groups are open to participation by anyone with an interest in their content.\n\nHL7 Work Groups consist of subject matter experts and other stakeholders. Each Work Group has a mailing list that you can join to communicate with the Work Group, including asking for time on an upcoming conference call. Work Groups also post conference call agendas on their Confluence sites (see the Work Group directory for Confluence links).\nEach Work Group lists their associated projects. Work Groups typically meet on a weekly basis for a conference call. There is a core leadership team for each Work Group that facilitates meetings. Attendees vary depending on agenda content.\nWork Groups also meet in-person or hybrid at HL7 Working Group Meetings, which are held three times per year.\n\nGetting started with Work Groups\nThe fastest way to get started in a Work Group is to join its conference call and ask to introduce yourself.\nAlternatively (or additionally), join the Work Group’s mailing list and reach out to the group’s leadership to introduce yourself. You can also use the mailing list to request future agenda items.\n\n\nTips for attending Work Group meetings:\n\nAsk to be on the agenda ahead of the meeting to get specific questions addressed.\nBe prepared to discuss your agenda item(s). Agendas are available ahead of the meeting on the Work Group’s Confluence page.\nShare your expertise. To ensure that new projects and specifications can be used by the community, Work Groups require input from a variety of stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Zulip (chat.fhir.org)\nZulip (chat.fhir.org) is an asynchronous communication platform like Slack or Teams messaging. Anyone may join. The platform is a valuable resource for asking questions and connecting with others with similar projects or objectives.\nZulip has “streams” (like “channels” on Slack) for general topics like Implementation Guide development and Terminology, as well as domain-specific topics like Cancer Interoperability. Users post comments or questions inside a stream, and others respond. You can find applicable streams by searching for your topic or browsing through the stream list.\n\nGetting started with Zulip\nBefore using Zulip, review HL7’s community expectations.\nIf you have a question and don’t know which stream to post it in, the #implementers stream is a good place to start.\nOther useful streams to subscribe to include:\n\n#Announcements: posts with new streams, releases of new versions of specifications, and ballot updates\n#implementers: discussion about implementing FHIR resources\n#analytics on FHIR: useful for those using FHIR interfaces and APIs for data analytics\n#social: general discussion about the FHIR community with the occasional fun update from a community member\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Connectathons\nConnectathons are events that connect contributors and community members to test FHIR technology. HL7 describes a Connectathon as:\n\n…an event that is centered on developing the HL7 FHIR Specification including resources, profiles and implementation guides. The purpose of a Connectathon is to prove that the specification is complete and facilitate FHIR implementation guide maturity.\n\nThree Connectathons are held each year, either as in-person events or as virtual meetings. Anyone can attend as a participant or submit a proposal to be a Track Lead. Connectathon Track Leads share their specification or resource for implementers to test and offer feedback. A complete list of the Tracks is posted before the Connectathon. You can also view offerings from previous Connectathons.\n\nGetting started\nFind information about upcoming Connectathons on HL7’s Connectathon events page or the Connectathon Confluence page.\nThe Connectathon FAQs provide information on requirements to participate.\nFirst time attendees must watch the FHIR Training for Beginners Newcomer Orientation.\nEach Connectathon hosts a virtual Participant Information Session several weeks before the event. The Participant Information Session includes information about which Tracks are available, how to connect with Track Leads, and how to prepare your sandbox environment for testing. For an example of what to expect, a recording of the January 2023 Connectathon Participant Information Session is available, as well as the check lists for attendees and Track Leads.\n\n\n\n2.4 FHIR Accelerators\nIn addition to developing the FHIR standard, HL7 has a FHIR Accelerator program to “assist communities and collaborative groups across the global health care spectrum in the creation and adoption of high quality FHIR Implementation Guides or other standard artifacts to move toward the realization of global health data interoperability.”\nFHIR Accelerators drive adoption of FHIR for specific use cases, including:\n\nCodeX: Standardizing cancer data\nDa Vinci: Establishing a process for addressing value-based care delivery\nGravity: Standardizing social determinants of health\nHelios: Obtaining data for public health via FHIR\nVulcan: Obtaining data for research via FHIR\n\nResearchers may be especially interested in Vulcan. This presentation from FHIR DevDays 2022 provides an overview of Vulcan’s current activity (PDF slides):\n\nMore information on the FHIR to OMOP project that is part of Vulcan can be found here."

    "text": "1 The structure of FHIR\nThe FHIR specification groups data elements into “resources,” like Patient for representing demographics and administrative information about an individual, and Observation for representing measurements and assertions about a patient or other subject.\nFHIR implementers can constrain what information gets included in a FHIR resource or use FHIR extensions to add information to a resource. They can also specify which FHIR resources should be used together for their use case. They share these constraints, extensions, and combinations with others through an Implementation Guide.\nBelow is a screenshot of the Patient resource from the FHIR specification (R4B version):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll FHIR resources have a Resource Content table.1 The table shows the hierarchy of elements in the FHIR resource. Elements might be one level deep (like Patient.birthDate) or nested (like Patient.contact.name).\nEach element has properties that appear in the Flag, Card. (short for “Cardinality”), and Type columns. The details of these properties are beyond the scope of this module; see Key FHIR Resources for more information.\nElements also have short descriptions (Description & Constraints) as well as longer descriptions. To see the longer description, click on the element’s name (e.g., see the details of Patient.gender).\nWhen a FHIR resource is created and populated with data, we call this an instance of the FHIR resource. An instance of the Patient resource would assign Patient.name to a value like Andy Smith. Instances are formatted in JSON or XML. To see an example of a patient instance formatted as JSON, expand the box below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJSON format FHIR Patient instance example\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an example of a what a FHIR resource instance looks like in JSON format.\n{\n  \"resourceType\": \"Patient\",\n  \"id\": \"f001\",\n  \"text\": {\n    \"status\": \"generated\",\n    \"div\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"identifier\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.6.3\",\n      \"value\": \"738472983\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.6.3\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"name\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"family\": \"van de Heuvel\",\n      \"given\": [\n        \"Pieter\"\n      ],\n      \"suffix\": [\n        \"MSc\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"gender\": \"male\",\n  \"birthDate\": \"1944-11-17\",\n  \"deceasedBoolean\": false,\n  \"managingOrganization\": {\n    \"reference\": \"Organization/f001\",\n    \"display\": \"Burgers University Medical Centre\"\n  }\n}"

    "section": "2 Customizing FHIR",
    "text": "2 Customizing FHIR\nThe FHIR specification follows the 80/20 rule to determine which data elements are included in a resource: data elements are typically included only if 80% of relevant systems will use them. Less common data needs are handled through FHIR extensions (discussed below). This means that FHIR-enabled systems will implement most common data elements consistently.\nTo maximize usability, data elements contained in FHIR resources have minimal constraints. Constraints restrict how a data element can be populated. For example, a constraint on Patient resource might require that Patient.birthDate be populated. However, some systems record a patient’s age in years rather than date of birth for privacy reasons. If the constraint on Patient.birthDate existed, those system would not be able to use the Patient resource.\nHowever, some use cases may require Patient.birthDate be populated. To achieve this, implementers can define use case-specific constraints on top of the base FHIR specification through profiling. The output of profiling is an Implementation Guide (IG), which is a collection of profiles that build on top of the FHIR specification (or other IGs).\n\n2.1 Example: customizing Patient in US Core\nThe US Core FHIR IG (referred to as “US Core” below) defines a FHIR implementation for USCDI, and is widely used in the US as the basis for FHIR implementations. In other words, EHRs in the US that support FHIR are likely also conformant with US Core.\nUS Core defines a profile of Patient, which does two things:\n\nAdds constraints: For example, the Patient resource in base FHIR does not require that the name element is populated. US Core’s profile of Patient adds a constraint to make name required.2\nAdds extensions: The base Patient resource in FHIR does not provide a way to capture patient race and ethnicity, which are common data elements in US health data. US Core adds Patient.us-core-race and Patient.us-core-ethnicity extensions to provide a consistent, interoperable way to store these data.\n\nMany other FHIR IGs include profiles that are based on US Core rather than directly on FHIR resources. For example, the mCODE IG, which defines a core set of data elements for oncology EHR data, includes a CancerPatient profile that is based on US Core’s Patient profile. Because US Core is widely implemented in US-based EHRs, it is helpful to base US-centric IGs off of US Core.\n\n\n2.2 Example: post-acute care data\nThe PACIO Project is a post-acute care interoperability project that publishes a FHIR IG to support exchange of relevant data.3\nThe following table shows how PACIO represents a narrative history of a patient’s functional status4 in their IG:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFHIR term\nPACIO’s approach using FHIR\nCommentary\n\n\n\n\nResource\nFunctional status data are represented with the Observation FHIR resource.\n“Observations are a central element in healthcare, used to support diagnosis, monitor progress, determine baselines and patterns...”5\n\n\nProfile\nPACIO provides a Narrative History of Functional Status profile of the Observation resource.\nAdds constraints like:\n\nRequire performer element to indicate who performed the assessment\nIdentifying functional status narrative records with LOINC concept 10158-4 (History of Functional status Narrative).\n\n\n\nExtension\nTwo extensions are defined by this profile:\n\nevent-location indicates where the observed event occurred.\nassistance-required indicates the level of assistance needed by the patient during assessment.\n\nThe base Observation resource does not have a mechanism for capturing these types of data.\n\n\n\n\nIn general, a concept like “narrative history of a patient’s functional status” will be represented by one or more profiles of FHIR resources in a FHRI IG, each with a set of relevant constraints and (if necessary) extensions.\nNote that extensions can make interoperability more difficult compared to using data elements in the base FHIR resources, so they should be used only when needed.\n\n\n2.3 Customizing FHIR and research\nThere are two research considerations for customizing FHIR:\n\nAre there existing FHIR IGs that are relevant? For example, oncology clinical trials might be able to take advantage of the mCODE IG. Find other potentially relevant IGs here.\nWould creating a FHIR IG provide value? For research that uses FHIR-formatted data, creating a study-specific IG provides a way to easily define element definitions and required data elements. More information on writing IGs is here."

As mentioned in Part 1, FHIR’s API uses a RESTful approach, which is a widely used throughout the technology industry. Find more specifics on FHIR’s API in the Accessing FHIR Data module.\nThe diagram below shows how FHIR’s API connects systems to each other:\n\nFor example, a FHIR Client (like the Apple Health app on an iPhone) can request data from a FHIR server using the “RESTful API over HTTP.” FHIR standardizes the request so the Apple Health app can use the same request regardless of which FHIR server they contact.\nLike with FHIR resources, the standard FHIR API doesn’t define all necessary operations for every use case. FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs) can also define additional API capabilities for a specific use case."

    "text": "3 FHIR\nHL7 developed FHIR in the early 2010s to provide a more interoperable alternative to V2 and a simpler alternative to V3.1 Like V3, FHIR uses common data formats (like JSON and XML). It also uses a common architecture (REST) for communication between systems. These design decisions make FHIR-enabled systems easier to integrate with mobile and cloud-based health applications compared to V2.\nRecall from FHIR from 1,000 Feet that:\n\nThe FHIR specification follows the 80/20 rule to determine which data elements are included in a resource: data elements are typically included only if 80% of relevant systems will use them. Less common data needs are handled through FHIR extensions. This means that FHIR-enabled systems will implement most common data elements consistently.\n\nIn late 2014, HL7 released the first official version of FHIR. By 2015, 87% of hospitals in the US were using FHIR certified EHRs as seen below. (Posnack and Barker 2018)\n\nThe late 2010s saw adoption outside of EHRs. For example, Apple uses FHIR in HealthKit for accessing patient health data directly from EHRs. The three major public cloud vendors (Amazon, Google, Microsoft) provide FHIR-enabled services as well.\n\n3.1 FHIR releases\nFHIR is currently on R5 (as of April 2023), which is the 5th major release of the FHIR specification. ONC provides a summary of FHIR releases since the first in 2012:\n\nHL7® FHIR® has evolved through four releases since its initial presentation in May 2012. It has grown from a true draft standard with 49 Resources to its current 145 and continues to expand. In that time the standard has improved and changed to meet the needs of the health information technology community.\nDraft standard for trial use 1 (DSTU1)\nFHIR’s first publication in September 2013 showed a new way forward for health care data exchange. Draft Standard for Trial Use 1 had 49 resources and focused on two use cases, creating a Personal Health Record on a mobile device and the retrieval of documents, such as encounter or discharge notes, to a mobile device. This initial release sparked the community’s interest in expanding FHIR to cover a wider variety of health care and health IT needs.\nDraft standard for trial use 2 (DSTU2)\nFHIR grew in market acceptance with the publication of the Draft Standard for Trial Use 2 in 2015. Efforts including the Argonaut Project developed Implementation Guides (IGs) and other technologies to support FHIR adoption by EHR developers and other health IT entities. The structure of Resources was adjusted to make creating extensions easier, allowing for more use cases to be covered without changes to the core standard. New Resources were also added to support non-clinical data, including claims and benefits processing.\nThe publication of FHIR DSTU2 included the creation of the FHIR Maturity Model (FMM). When new Resources are created, they are not immediately ready for use in live settings; they must be refined and tested for a variety of uses and settings. The FHIR Maturity Model established a set of levels that progressively measure technical advancement, known as maturity. Resource maturity as defined by the FMM begins with an initial draft and achieves final status with implementation in multiple settings. Since the maturity of the FHIR standard overall is not tied to the maturity of Resources, Resources can move up the maturity ladder between FHIR releases. The FMM, which is also applied to other components of the FHIR standard, defines Resource stability with six levels:\n\nFMM0 (Draft) - The resource is still in early development but has been accepted into the FHIR standard.\nFMM1 - The Resource has no current technical errors and is believed to address all design goals.\nFMM2 - The Resource has been tested and approved at a FHIR Connectathon with multiple FHIR-enabled computer systems tested.\nFMM3 - The Resource passed all quality checks and an HL7 community ballot that determines if it is ready for trial use.\nFMM4 - The Resource has been tested for functionality for all intended purposes, has been published in a formal HL7 publication, and is operating in at least one prototype system.\nFMM5 - The Resource is in use in at least five distinct production systems operating in at least two countries.\n\nSubstantive changes at the FMM4 or FMM5 levels that would change usage from those already established or would break compatibility with existing implementations would require significant justification to be accepted and to move forward. After FMM5, a Resource reaches “normative”1 level; at this level, future changes must be backwards compatible so that applications that implement those Resources aren’t at risk of being broken as the FHIR standard changes.\nStandard for trial use 3 (STU 3)\nFHIR Standard for Trial Use 3 was released in 2017 with improvements to the core Clinical, Administrative, and Financial Resources, improvements to the Clinical Decision Support and Clinical Quality Measure Resources and a new framework for workflow and task management. Additionally, tools were introduced that made FHIR IG creation and publication to the web easier, faster, and more unified.\nRelease 4 (R4)\nAs the first release with normative content, the 2019 release of FHIR Release 4 left behind the Trial Use name. Two key clinical Resources, Patient and Observation, were released as normative, along with the RESTful API, the XML and JSON formats, and nine additional Resources.\nIn 2020, ONC published the Final Rule for the 21st Century Cures Act, establishing FHIR R4 as the standard required for Health IT Certification.\nLooking ahead to Release 5 (R5)\nFHIR Release 5 will see increased normative content, with over 30 Resources having been nominated by their HL7 Workgroups to be matured to that status. In addition, the community will continue to develop the supportive specifications to FHIR, such as the authorization framework SMART, Clinical Decision Support Hooks (CDS Hooks), and the Bulk Data Transfer specification, which will help implementers create a complete FHIR-based exchange of health care data.\nWith the maturing of the FHIR IG tools and templates, better integration with public health, imaging, financial management, genomics and other fields will keep FHIR at the forefront of health IT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: FHIR R5 was officially released in March 2023."

    "section": "4 The Patient resource",
    "text": "4 The Patient resource\nHere is a FHIR structure table for the Patient resource:\n\n\n\nThe structure for FHIR Patient resource.\n\n\nAll FHIR resources have a similar table representing their contents. These tables have the following columns:\n\nName: The element name.\nFlags: Special markers that carry information required for implementers. The flags N, ?!, and Σ represent normative, is-modifier, and in-summary respectively. We will not cover FHIR attribute flags in detail here, but HL7 documents them.\nCard.: The cardinality of the attribute in format {minimum}..{maximum}. Cardinality refers to the number of data points an element can hold. The most intuitive cardinality values are 1..1 which means “one value required” and 0..1, which means “one value is optional. However, other options are possible, like 0..*, which means”any number of values.”3\nType: The primitive or complex data type. A primitive data type is a base data type, like date or integer. A complex data type is constructed from other data types, like Address.\nDescription & Constraints: A human-targeted explanation of the element that may contain constraints that implementers must enforce. Constraints (like “element X must be populated if element Y is missing”) may be formally defined through a language called FHIRPath.\n\nDefining a FHIR resource automatically generates a structure table, so structure tables are available for any resource.\n\n4.1 Basic types example: Patient.active\nUnder “Patient” there is an element active which is referred to as Patient.active. From the table we know that Patient.active is a boolean (i.e., “true” or “false”) and can either be omitted or have one value (cardinality 0..1).\nAn example of the Patient.active element in JSON format would look like:\n{\n  ...\n  \"active\": \"true\",\n  ...\n}\nAnd in XML:\n...\n&lt;active value=\"true\"/&gt;\n...\n\n\n4.2 Complex types example: Patient.name\nPatient.name is of complex type HumanName. Complex types are FHIR resources and have their own structure table. Here’s the one for HumanName:\n\n\n\nThe structure for Patient.name, which is a HumanName.\n\n\nHumanName’s elements all have primitive types, such as HumanName.given, an array of zero or more strings, and HumanName.use, a code-string that must be one of the provided values. As an example, the name Pieter van de Heuvel would be represented in JSON as:\n{\n  \"name\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"family\": \"van de Heuvel\",\n      \"given\": [\n        \"Pieter\"\n      ],\n      \"suffix\": [\n        \"MSc\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flexibility of FHIR’s data modeling approach\n\n\n\nThe structure of HumanName highlights the flexibility of FHIR’s approach to modeling data. HumanName allocates seven separate elements to represent a person’s name. Compare this with a standard approach in a relational database, which would typically allocate only a few fields.\nIn FHIR, all of these elements are, allowing for flexibility in how implementers represent names. For example, some implementers might store names as a single string (e.g., Pieter van de Heuvel, MSc), while others might split up the name parts into separate elements (like the JSON above).\nMaking elements optional balances flexibility with interoperability: this approach provides a standard location and encoding for the data element in question, without requiring all systems to populate it. This approach is used throughout the core FHIR resource definitions.\nThis degree of flexibility is not helpful in all use cases. FHIR addresses this through resource Profiles, which provide a way to computably describe use case-specific constraints (e.g., “all names must include a family element”). Profiles are collected in Implementation Guides (IGs) to provide a complete specification based on FHIR for a given use case.\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Choice elements example: Patient.deceased[x]\nElements that can have more than one data type are called choice elements. The Patient.deceased[x] attribute demonstrates some characteristics of a choice element.\n\nThe term Patient.deceased[x], with [x] in the name, appears in documentation only–never in an instance of Patient that’s been populated with data.\nInstead, one and only one of the following may appear in an instance of Patient: Patient.deceasedBoolean or Patient.deceasedDateTime. The documentation shows that these are the two valid types for Patient.deceased[x].\nAll choice elements must have a maximum cardinality of 1 per the FHIR specification.\nPatient.deceased[x] happens to have a minimum cardinality of 0, so an instance of Patient may also omit both Patient.deceasedBoolean and Patient.deceasedDateTime. Other choice elements may have a minimum cardinality of 1 and require one of the indicated datatypes.\n\nThis flexibility allows the status of non-deceased patients to be represented by Patient.deceasedBoolean = false or an absent value, while deceased patients can be represented by Patient.deceasedBoolean = true or Patient.deceasedDateTime = \"2023-01-01T01:01:01\".\nChoice elements are always denoted by a [x] suffix in documentation. The [x] is replaced with the name of the datatype in CamelCase: deceased[x] becomes deceasedDateTime for the dateTime type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing choice elements\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile choice elements provide flexibility, they add complexity for implementers, including researchers. When working with choice elements, consider the following:\n\nAssume that any of a choice element’s possible types may be present. For example, a tabular representation of Patient instances would include two columns related to “deceased”: deceased_boolean and deceased_datetime. An analyst could add logic to collapse this down to a single column for a given analysis (e.g., logic like, “if deceased_datetime is not empty and deceased_boolean is missing, then set deceased_boolean to true”).\nWhen possible, use existing software libraries to do the FHIR-to-tabular conversion, such as R’s fhircrackr, which may simplify handling choice elements.\nWhen developing custom software, use FHIR’s official list of choice elements to systematically handle them rather than hard-coding special cases for each resource.\nIf possible, use FHIR profiles to add constraints to disallow undesirable datatypes for choice elements. For example, if Patient.deceasedDateTime is never useful for a given use case, a profile of Patient could disallow Patient.deceasedDateTime and require Patient.deceasedBoolean. This is like defining a data dictionary ahead of data collection and can drastically simplify analysis as long as the data sources also implement the custom profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 CodeableConcepts example: Patient.maritalStatus\nPatient.maritalStatus is a CodeableConcept, which is a commonly used complex type in FHIR. CodeableConcepts bind an attribute to a specific set of terminology concepts. Patient.maritalStatus is bound to the Marital Status Codes Value Set. For more on FHIR’s terminology resources, see the terminology module.\nIn addition to identifying a value set for the binding, a CodeableConcept also identifies the strength of the binding:\n\nrequired binding: The value of the element must be from the specified value set.\nextensible binding: If a code in the specified value set represents the concept, then that code must be used. Otherwise, a different code can be used.\npreferred binding: The use of codes from the specified value set is encouraged but not required.\nexample binding: The specified value set is an example, and codes outside the specified value set can be used freely.\n\nThe base FHIR specification generally does not have required bindings as these restrict the flexibility of resources. Instead, required bindings are added for specific use cases via FHIR profiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing CodeableConcepts\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementers and researchers should consider the following when implementing CodeableConcepts:\n\nUsing a FHIR profile to require specific value sets simplifies analysis.\nUnless an element has a required binding, do not assume that FHIR data will only include codes from the specified value set. Make sure you perform an exploratory data analysis for any CodeableConcept binding strength other than required.\nFor example, the Patient.maritalStatus binding is extensible: while you may see values from the bound value set (like M for married), you may also see values from other value sets (like the SNOMED CT concept 54986009 “Engaged to be married (finding)” ).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Inheritance in FHIR\nIn software engineering, inheritance is a common pattern for sharing attributes across similar classes (e.g., a parent class called “pet” might have two child classes called “dog” and “cat”. “Dog” and “cat” inherit properties from the “pet” parent class, like “name,” “weight,” and “cuteness.”).\nFHIR has a similar pattern, where resources like Patient inherit from a parent type called DomainResource. You can see this in the first row of the structure table for Patient:\n\n\n\nThe first few rows of the structure table of the Patient resource, with an arrow indicating that Patient is a DomainResource.\n\n\nSimilarly, DomainResource is a child of Resource, which is the base of almost all FHIR resources. Because FHIR resources are children of DomainResource, they have the same set of core elements in their computable representation. This is useful if you are writing software that needs to process resource definitions from the FHIR specification.\nFHIR profiles also exhibit inheritance, where a profile inherits the constraints from another profile or from a base FHIR resource.\n\n\n4.6 A Patient Example\nTo summarize the Patient resource, here is an anonymized example from the real world:\n{\n  \"resourceType\": \"Patient\",\n  \"id\": \"f001\",\n  \"text\": {\n    \"status\": \"generated\",\n    \"div\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"identifier\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.6.3\",\n      \"value\": \"738472983\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"system\": \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.6.3\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"name\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"usual\",\n      \"family\": \"van de Heuvel\",\n      \"given\": [\n        \"Pieter\"\n      ],\n      \"suffix\": [\n        \"MSc\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"telecom\": [\n    {\n      \"system\": \"phone\",\n      \"value\": \"0648352638\",\n      \"use\": \"mobile\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"system\": \"email\",\n      \"value\": \"p.heuvel@gmail.com\",\n      \"use\": \"home\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"gender\": \"male\",\n  \"birthDate\": \"1944-11-17\",\n  \"deceasedBoolean\": false,\n  \"address\": [\n    {\n      \"use\": \"home\",\n      \"line\": [\n        \"Van Egmondkade 23\"\n      ],\n      \"city\": \"Amsterdam\",\n      \"postalCode\": \"1024 RJ\",\n      \"country\": \"NLD\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"maritalStatus\": {\n    \"coding\": [\n      {\n        \"system\": \"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-MaritalStatus\",\n        \"code\": \"M\",\n        \"display\": \"Married\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"text\": \"Getrouwd\"\n  },\n  \"multipleBirthBoolean\": true,\n  \"contact\": [\n    {\n      \"relationship\": [\n        {\n          \"coding\": [\n            {\n              \"system\": \"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0131\",\n              \"code\": \"C\"\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"name\": {\n        \"use\": \"usual\",\n        \"family\": \"Abels\",\n        \"given\": [\n          \"Sarah\"\n        ]\n      },\n      \"telecom\": [\n        {\n          \"system\": \"phone\",\n          \"value\": \"0690383372\",\n          \"use\": \"mobile\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"communication\": [\n    {\n      \"language\": {\n        \"coding\": [\n          {\n            \"system\": \"urn:ietf:bcp:47\",\n            \"code\": \"nl\",\n            \"display\": \"Dutch\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"text\": \"Nederlands\"\n      },\n      \"preferred\": true\n    }\n  ],\n  \"managingOrganization\": {\n    \"reference\": \"Organization/f001\",\n    \"display\": \"Burgers University Medical Centre\"\n  }\n}\nNote that JSON representations of resources begin with resourceType: \"&lt;resource&gt;\" to indicate the base FHIR resource type.\nIn XML representations of resources, the tag enclosing the data identifies the resource type (in this case, &lt;Patient ...&gt; ... &lt;/Patient&gt;).\nTypically, JSON is easier to read (both for humans and computers) than XML, so JSON is used primarily in FHIR for Research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing FHIR in JSON and XML\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the JSON and XML representations of FHIR, implementers and researchers should be aware of the following:\n\nIn either JSON or XML, the underlying data of the FHIR resource are the same. You can convert between JSON and XML representations of FHIR data without loss of information.\nYou should use JSON by default when writing code to ingest in FHIR instances (or computable representations of FHIR profiles or resource definitions).\nWhen requesting FHIR data from a server, you can specify the format of the response.\nIf you work with R, the fhircrackr library uses the XML representation of FHIR resource instances. If you use this library, you will need basic familiarity with XML to extract data elements from the FHIR resource instances."

NDJSON is more efficient than Bundle for large data transfers, and, as of March 1st 2023, FHIR R5 includes NDJSON in Draft status.

Note: this does not include foundational resources such as CapabilityStatement or Bundle, but typically resources level 3 and higher.\nCapabilityStatement.rest[i].resource.interaction: The RESTful interactions available for that resource by the server. For example, the search interaction is a RESTful API action available in FHIR. The CapabilityStatement.rest[i].resource.searchParam field specifies what search parameters are possible.\n\nProperly implemented FHIR servers must provide an instance of CapabilityStatement at the /metadata endpoint.4 This provides a way for software to discover key information about the features of a given FHIR server. Note that the real-world capabilities of a FHIR server may not match its stated capabilities, so software that accesses FHIR servers should be resilient to deviations from the published CapabilityStatements."

(2021) describe the development of the Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS), which facilitates the exchange of data between REDCap and any EHR via the FHIR API. As of September 2022, 40 institutions in the US and Canada have integrated REDCap with their Epic or Cerner EHR (Alex C. Cheng et al. 2023), which represents a small portion of the total number of institutions that have implemented REDCap. However, integrating REDCap with FHIR can provide significant value to researchers by making clinical data more accessible without requiring manually querying FHIR endpoints.\nREDCap on FHIR/CDIS includes two approaches:\nAccording to A.

    "text": "Implementation approach\nDue to the relatively low percentage of institutions that have implemented REDCap on FHIR, it is unlikely this is available at your institution. If you are interested in pursuing an implementation at your institution, the following approaches may be useful.\nHawley et al. (2021) describe a usability and implementation study at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in which they used REDCap to capture self-assessments from patients and transfer the data into a Cerner EHR. When a patient arrived the process saved time, improved the accuracy of data going into the EHR, and made the data accessible in real-time. While not specific to FHIR, the useful roles and responsibilities for implementing REDCap listed in this paper should apply to REDCap on FHIR implementations as well:\n\n\nClinical REDCap administrator: Clinical REDCap staff responsible for account creation, modification, and suspension for all user types. Responsible for moving projects and draft changes to production. Limited to 2-3 staff members.\nProject developer administrator: Clinical REDCap staff responsible for creating REDCap projects and associated forms or surveys. Leads project validation to be carried out in collaboration with clinical stakeholders.\nService administrator: Specialized account for managing secure services post data collection (e.g., application programming interface data export to electronic health record).\nClinical data lead: Clinical staff responsible for monitoring the integrity of the data, providing clinic-specific training to clinic users, supporting minor technical issues in the clinic, facilitating project validation, submitting project change requests, approving subordinate account requests, and serving as the main point of contact for developers and administrators.\nClinical care provider: Clinical staff responsible for the administration and review of clinical assessments; can enter data that have been collected on paper into REDCap.\nClinical assistant: Clinical support staff responsible for administering patient survey queue in the clinic and providing simple technical assistance.\n\n\nAdditionally, for REDCap on FHIR, close collaboration with the EHR implementation team and informaticists who are familiar with your institution’s EHR is necessary.\nMaré et al. (2022) focused on the adoption of REDCap in academic and clinical environments identified similar roles and strategies to facilitate the process. They identified the following methods to support new REDCap users, listed below. Again, these are not specific to REDCap on FHIR but are still applicable.\n\n\ntop-down organizational support;\nsecure and reliable application, hosting infrastructure, and systems administration; an enabling and accessible REDCap support team;\nregular hands-on training workshops covering REDCap project setup and data collection instrument design techniques;\nannual local symposia to promote networking and awareness of all the latest software features and best practices for using them;\nparticipation in REDCap Consortium activities;\nand regular and ongoing mentorship from members of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\n\nThe authors also used two strategies to support adoption of REDCap:\n\nBuilding trust among researchers in the security and reliability of REDCap through several layers of back-up should any component fail and simulated data loss and retrieval exercises.\nEstablishing a REDCap administrator that acted as a dedicated, go-to person that could answer researchers’ questions and offer consultations."

REDCap provides functionality common to other web-based survey platforms (e.g., SurveyMonkey or Qualtrics) with a number of additional features that are specific for research. More background information on REDCap is available in Patridge and Bardyn (2018), and at https://projectredcap.org/software/.\nREDCap has grown into a global community with 3200 partner institutions in 128 countries and more than 56,000 projects (Harris et al. 2019). To determine if your institution has REDCap, you can search here or ask your research informatics leader. Your institution’s IRB is also likely aware if REDCap is actively being used.\nREDCap can be run inside an institution’s firewall and may be configured to support storing identified health information for research purposes."

    "text": "Use cases\nCommon research uses of REDCap include:\n\nCollecting self-reported survey data from study participants (patients or providers)\nDigital capture and storage of informed consent documents\nEntering, storing, and querying clinical information, like for a disease registry (for example, see Metke-Jimenez and Hansen (2019) below or @shalhout2022) or a vaccine status tracker (see Lenert et al. (2023) described below)\nCase report forms (for example, see Cheng et al. (2023) below)\nChart abstraction (for example, see Mayer et al. (2022))\n\nA more detailed look at example use cases follows.\n\nExample use case: vaccine status tracker\nLenert et al. (2023) tested a population-level vaccination status tracker, called VACtrac, using a combination of two approaches:\n\nA FHIR-compatible copy of the existing statewide Immunization Information System (IIS), with a REDCap data warehouse\nA REDCap health management program with a list of patients for providers to maintain communication with and update vaccination status records, either through a Bulk FHIR update or one-time query.\n\nVACtrac uses REDCap Clinical Data Interoperability Services (CDIS) FHIR plug-in for both Epic and Cerner EHRs to extract patient information. The REDCap database can be accessed and updated by multiple providers, so the burden of maintaining vaccination information can be spread among multiple providers.\nThe REDCap vaccination status tracker is publicly available for adaption in other institutions.\n\n\nExample use case: cancer registry\nMetke-Jimenez and Hansen (2019) implemented FHIRCap, a transformation engine, to translate data in a REDCap project to FHIR resources. The authors tested FHIRCap on an existing REDCap form and database for a cancer registry. They were able to transform the information from REDCap to FHIR resources and then map the codes to SNOMED CT. While the process was manual and time intensive to set up, the rules only have to be written once for a project and can be used as long as the REDCap form doesn’t change.\n\n\nExample use case: case report forms\nCheng et al. (2023) describe how REDCap can be used to collect electronic case report forms, and how data elements on these forms may be populated automatically using REDCap’s integration with FHIR. Automatic population of these forms has the potential to increase accuracy and decrease the burden of manual data entry.\nNote that it is also possible to extract data from an EHR or other clinical system without FHIR, and load this into REDCap using its import capability."

For example, several researchers have trialed new clinical decision support (CDS) systems using SMART on FHIR. They use SMART on FHIR to integrate their CDS tool into EHRs without modifying the EHRs and without creating unique versions for each EHR vendor.\nTarumi et al. (2021) used this approach to show that an AI-driven CDS could integrate with Epic via SMART on FHIR, and Curran et al. (2020) used this approach to prototype a CDS system for chronic disease management.\n\n\n1.2 Adding data to an EHR workflow\nResearchers also use SMART on FHIR to add data to EHR workflows. For example, a patient may use a web or smartphone app to report their outcomes data. A SMART on FHIR application can make this data accessible from an EHR (Wesley et al. 2021).\nSMART on FHIR can also help researchers integrate data into an EHR that the EHR does not natively support. For example, Watkins and Eilbeck (2020) discuss how genetic testing could be better-integrated with EHRs using SMART on FHIR and CDS Hooks (see below).\n\n\n1.3 Accessing bulk data\nSMART on FHIR facilitated Bulk Data Access (see below) may provide a new way for researchers to access population-level data. A researcher may want to gather population data from multiple institutions that do not store their data using a shared common data model. However, if these EHRs use FHIR, they likely use the widely implemented US Core FHIR Implementation Guide. SMART on FHIR with Bulk Data Access would enable researchers to access the data as US Core-conforming FHIR resource instances across these institutions.\nNote, SMART on FHIR used for Bulk Data Access is relatively new and has not yet appeared in peer-reviewed research publications.\n\n\n1.4 SMART on FHIR app gallary\nThe SMART App Gallery lists a number of SMART on FHIR applications, which may provide additional ideas on how SMART on FHIR could be used for research."

For example, “a health system may want to periodically retrieve updated clinical data from an EHR to a research database.”\nHL7 first released the Bulk Data Access standard in 2019 and released v2 in November 2022.\nMany EHR vendors, including Allscripts, Athena Health, Cerner, and Epic, have adopted this standard. In January 2023, ONC announced its support for this standard.\nThe Bulk Data Access standard is part of the SMART ecosystem, and SMART on FHIR can be used to authenticate and authorize applications that retrieve bulk data automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, see this overview presentation and the HL7 specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 CDS Hooks\nCDS Hooks is an HL7 standard that can support SMART on FHIR application integration with EHRs. HL7 released CDS Hooks v2 in August 2022.\nCDS Hooks allows an action in an EHR to trigger an action in a third-party application. Thiess et al. (2022) writes:\n\nTo make CDS accessible when it is needed, the standard defines several hooks that occur through clinicians interacting with the EHR. For example, the patient-view hook is triggered when the patient record is opened, or the order-select hook is triggered when the prescriber selects an order (e.g., medication or procedure).\n\nThe standard includes ways for the third-party application to get contextual information related to the hook, like the patient data being viewed. The application can then send information back to the EHR. Thiess et al. (2022) continues:\n\nThe CDS Hooks service provides a response in the form of a “Card” that is displayed inside the EHR. There are three types of cards: (i) information cards provide patient-specific information, such as an assessment or reference information; (ii) suggestion cards provide a recommended action (e.g., an order) in a FHIR resource; and (iii) app cards provide a link to launch a SMART on FHIR app.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\nMorgan et al. (2022) demonstrate that CDS Hooks can increase utilization of SMART on FHIR applications.\nStrasberg et al. (2021) describes additional background information on how CDS Hooks function.\nThiess et al. (2022) provides more details on how CDS Hooks can be integrated with an EHR and a SMART on FHIR application."

If your institution has staff with experience integrating SMART on FHIR applications, consult with them early when developing your research approach.\nSMART on FHIR applications that integrate with an EHR’s user interface via SMART App Launch are often web applications. SMART on FHIR applications that run without being triggered by user input in an EHR, including applications that use Bulk Data Access, are often backend services.\nIntegrating SMART on FHIR backend applications with EHRs is often less complex than integrating SMART on FHIR web applications. However, in both cases, there may be EHR-specific requirements including administrative approval.\nAlso, consider security and privacy early when developing your research approach. Take steps to ensure proper data storage and access as you would with any software that handles sensitive data. In addition to IRB approval, you may need approval related to privacy and information security. If your institution has not worked with SMART on FHIR before, it may not have a well-defined process for getting the appropriate approvals. In this case, it may be helpful to identify researchers from other institutions who have used SMART on FHIR in a similar context, and cite their work to demonstrate prior successful use of this technology when discussing with the IRB and decision-makers at your institution.\nPlease see SMART on FHIR Technical Details for more technical implementation on using SMART on FHIR and related standards."

    "text": "1 High-level technical considerations\n\n1.1 Authorization pattern\nAuthorization ensures that the user of an application has permission to perform specific actions. For SMART-on-FHIR applications, it ensures the user is allowed to access the FHIR data they are requesting.\nYour SMART on FHIR application will use one of the authorization patterns defined by the SMART App Launch specification.\n\nSMART App Launch supports applications that launch in an EHR or launch standalone:\n\nEHR Launch: A user launches the application within the EHR from an existing EHR session (e.g., custom a clinical decision support application).\nStandalone Launch: A user launches the application directly, like in a smartphone or stand-alone website (e.g., Apple’s Health app on the iPhone).\n\nSMART Backend Services support applications that run autonomously, like an automated data pipeline. SMART Backend Services are also used for user-facing applications where the FHIR authorization service does not need the user’s information (e.g., a dashboard application).\n\n\n\n1.2 Software libraries\nOpen-source libraries exist in many programming languages to help developers work with FHIR data and SMART App Launch.\ndocs.smarthealthit.org lists the following software libraries that support SMART App Launch:\n\n\nJavaScript or TypeScript: Client-side and server-side library with support for SMART App Launch\nNode.js from Vermonster: An alternative Node.js implementation\nPython: Server-side Python library with support for SMART App Launch\nR\nRuby\nSwift (iOS)\nJava\n.NET: FHIR client library from Firely\n\n\nHL7’s Confluence site also has a list of FHIR-related software libraries.\nYou can create a SMART on FHIR application without relying on third-party libraries, but using a third-party library will likely save development time.\n\n\n1.3 Security and privacy\nFHIR servers will likely return health data that can be linked to an individual. If so, rules around handling Protected Health Information (PHI) apply. Your institution’s IRB will also have policies for handling sensitive patient data used in research.\nDetermine the security and privacy approach for health data early in your design process before working with any real patient data. You can use synthetic data and a test FHIR server during development and testing.\n\n\n1.4 Human-centered design\nIf you are developing a user-facing application, consider a human-centered design approach. From ISO 9241-210:2019:\n\nHuman-centered design is an approach to interactive systems development that aims to make systems usable and useful by focusing on the users, their needs and requirements, and by applying human factors/ergonomics, and usability knowledge and techniques. This approach enhances effectiveness and efficiency, improves human well-being, user satisfaction, accessibility and sustainability; and counteracts possible adverse effects of use on human health, safety and performance.\n\nFor more information on human-centered design in healthcare research, see Göttgens and Oertelt-Prigione (2021)."

This will be the testing “app” for this example:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n        &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Example SMART App&lt;/title&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- Use the SMART on FHIR JavaScript library --&gt;\n        &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fhirclient/build/fhir-client.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n        &lt;!-- Use Bootstrap for styling --&gt;\n        &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css\"&gt;\n        &lt;style&gt;\n            /* Additional styling for text boxes that will show JSON data */\n            #patient, #meds {\n                font-family: Monaco, monospace;\n                white-space: pre;\n                font-size: 13px;\n                height: 38vh;\n                overflow: scroll;\n                border: 1px solid #CCC;\n            }\n        &lt;/style&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;nav class=\"navbar bg-primary\" style=\"margin-bottom: 2vh\"&gt;\n          &lt;div class=\"container-fluid\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"navbar-brand mb-0 h1 text-white\"&gt;Example SMART on FHIR Application&lt;/span&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/nav&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n            &lt;h4&gt;Current Patient&lt;/h4&gt;\n            &lt;div id=\"patient\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;br/&gt;\n            &lt;h4&gt;Medications&lt;/h4&gt;\n            &lt;div id=\"meds\"&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\n                FHIR.oauth2.ready().then(function(client) {\n                    \n                    // Render the current patient (or any error)\n                    client.patient.read().then(\n                        function(pt) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"patient\").innerText = JSON.stringify(pt, null, 4);\n                        },\n                        function(error) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"patient\").innerText = error.stack;\n                        }\n                    );\n                    \n                    // Get MedicationRequests for the selected patient\n                    client.request(\"/MedicationRequest?patient=\" + client.patient.id, {\n                        resolveReferences: [ \"medicationReference\" ],\n                        graph: true\n                    })\n                    \n                    // Reject if no MedicationRequests are found\n                    .then(function(data) {\n                        if (!data.entry || !data.entry.length) {\n                            throw new Error(\"No medications found for the selected patient\");\n                        }\n                        return data.entry;\n                    })\n                    \n\n                    // Render the current patient's medications (or any error)\n                    .then(\n                        function(meds) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"meds\").innerText = JSON.stringify(meds, null, 4);\n                        },\n                        function(error) {\n                            document.getElementById(\"meds\").innerText = error.stack;\n                        }\n                    );\n\n                }).catch(console.error);\n            &lt;/script&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\nStep 4: Run a local web server\n\nOpen a command prompt window and go to the folder you created.\nRun a command to start a local web server on port 8000. For example, if you have Python 3 on your system run:\npython3 -m http.server 8000\nFor Python 2, run:\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\n\nFor more information on using Python as a local web server, review Mozilla’s test server guide. If you don’t have Python, you can use Ruby or a Node package.\nOnce you are running the server, navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see a page that looks like this:\n\nNote: data will not load by opening index.html in your browser. To load data, you must go through the EHR launch flow (see next step).\n\n\nStep 5: Test with launch.smarthealthit.org\nGo to https://launch.smarthealthit.org, enter localhost:8000/launch.html for in the “App’s Launch URL” field, and click “Launch”.\nYou should see the following happen:\n\n\n\n\n2.3 App launch process explanation\nHere’s a visual diagram of the process that occurs when you launch your example application with launch.smarthealthit.org:\n\n\n\n\n\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant A as localhost:8000/launch.html\n    participant B as launch.smarthealthit.org\n    participant C as localhost:8000/index.html\n    participant D as FHIR Server\n\n    B -&gt;&gt; B: Launch triggered via test website\n    B -&gt;&gt; A: Launch requested\n    A -&gt;&gt; B: Authorization request\n    B -&gt;&gt; B: Dummy provider log-in and patient selection\n    B -&gt;&gt; C: Authorization granted\n    C -&gt;&gt; B: Access token request\n    B --&gt;&gt; C: Access token response\n    C -&gt;&gt; D: Request Patient\n    D --&gt;&gt; C: Response with Patient JSON\n    C -&gt;&gt; D: Request MedicationRequests\n    D --&gt;&gt; C: Response with MedicationRequest JSON\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the details of this process:\n\nYou trigger the application launch by clicking “Launch” on launch.smarthealthit.org. This simulates an EHR user triggering a SMART on FHIR app launch using a link in the EHR.\nIn this case, launch.smarthealthit.org redirects your browser to http://localhost:8000/launch.html?iss=http%3A%2F%2Flaunch.smarthealthit.org%2Fv%2Fr4%2Ffhir&launch=....\nThe SMART App Launch documentation explains the two parameters in this URL:\n\n\niss: Identifies the EHR’s FHIR endpoint, which the app can use to obtain additional details about the EHR including its authorization URL.\nlaunch: Opaque identifier for this specific launch and any EHR context associated with it. This parameter must be communicated back to the EHR at authorization time.\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8000/launch.html loads in your browser, and FHIR.oauth2.authorize() is called with the options defined in launch.html’s source code. The authorize() method obtains an authorization code from the testing server’s “authorize” endpoint. In this case, it does this by triggering a browser redirect to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/auth/authorize with a number of parameters.\nYour browser loads a page on the launch.smarthealthit.org server simulating provider log-in and patient selection. (Note: If this application was being used in a real-world EHR, the provider would be logged in through the EHR and the selected patient would be whichever patient the provider was viewing when they launched the app in the EHR.)\nThis dummy flow gathers the information needed for launch.smarthealthit.org to provide the example application with the authorization code. It does this by redirecting your browser to localhost:8000/index.html?code=...&state=.... It knows to take you to localhost:8000/index.html because you specified the parameter redirectUri: \"index.html\" in the source code of launch.html.\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html loads in your browser and calls FHIR.oauth2.ready(). This creates a Client instance that handles obtaining and refreshing the OAuth access token needed to authorize access to the FHIR server, and making requests to the FHIR server with the proper headers.\nIn this case, a call is made to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/auth/token, which responds with the authorization token that must be passed along with any requests for FHIR data.\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html calls client.patient.read() to request the Patient resource instance from the FHIR server (in this case, this results in a call to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/fhir/Patient/39234650-0229-4aee-975b-c8ee68bab40b) and displays the raw JSON returned by the server. Note that the read() method automatically includes the authorization token from (4).\nhttp://localhost:8000/index.html calls client.request(...) to request the MedicationRequest resource instances from the FHIR server (in this case, this results in a call to https://launch.smarthealthit.org/v/r4/fhir/MedicationRequest?patient=39234650-0229-4aee-975b-c8ee68bab40b) and displays the raw JSON returned by the server. Note that the request() method automatically includes the authorization token from (4).\n\nNow that the application has access to FHIR data, common front-end web development techniques could be used to create an application that utilizes this data.\nThis example assumes a SMART on FHIR-enabled server (like the https://launch.smarthealthit.org testing server used above). See this tutorial for more information on setting up a SMART on FHIR-enabled server.\nAdditionally, Cerner’s browser-based app tutorial provides more detail on setting up a browser-based SMART on FHIR application."

    "title": "Customizing Synthea Data",
    "section": "1 Creating and Editing Modules",
    "text": "1 Creating and Editing Modules\nFor the most detailed and up-to-date guidance on creating and editing modules, see the Generic Module Framework section on the Synthea wiki.\nWhile the module JSONs can technically be written by hand, we strongly recommend using the Module Builder to edit modules graphically.\nBefore starting with the module builder, we recommend watching a short video introduction to the Module Builder, and reading through a module builder tutorial on the Synthea Wiki.\n\n1.1 Creating a New Module\nIn the Module Builder, click the “New Module” button in the upper left. This will open a new tab in the builder with the simplest possible module: an Initial state that transitions directly to a Terminal state.\n\nEither state can be clicked on to select it and change the name, type, transition, or other properties via the sidebar. As you familiarize yourself with the module builder, try clicking on the various fields to see what options are available. No changes here can directly affect Synthea, so don’t worry, it is completely impossible to break anything (though it is possible to lose work, so we recommend downloading work-in-progress modules to a file often). If you make a mistake, nearly any change can be undone with the Undo button.\nTo add new states to the module, click the “+ Add State” button in the upper right of the editor. This will do slightly different things based on what is currently selected in the module graph:\n\nIf nothing is selected, the new state will be added off to the side. You must manually connect other states to it, and it to other states by editing the transitions.\nIf a state is selected, the new state will be added “at the end” of the selected state. The selected state will now transition directly to the new state, and the new state will have the original transition from the selected state.\nIf a transition arrow is selected, the new state will be added “inside” the transition. The transition will now point to the new state, and the new state will transition directly to the original target of the transition.\n\n\n\n1.2 Editing an Existing Module\nTo load an existing module for editing, first click the “Open Module” button at the top of the Module Builder. From the load module screen there are a few options:\n\nThe “Core Modules” and “Submodules” are a good first step for exploring the various modules available.\nThe “GitHub modules” tab loads modules directly from various branches on the core Synthea repository on GitHub.\nYou can also drag & drop a module JSON file onto the modal, click to open a file browser to select a JSON file, or paste the JSON content of the file into the “Paste JSON” tab.\nThe “Local Storage” and “My Modules” tabs will be empty initially, but as you use the module builder these may be populated with modules you edit.\n\nOnce a module is loaded, you can add, edit, or remove states just as you would if you were creating a new module. Note that no matter how you load a module into the module builder, you are editing a copy. As before, this means you should feel free to experiment without worrying about breaking anything, but do download your module regularly to make sure you don’t lose work if something goes wrong.\n\n\n1.3 Loading Modules Into Synthea\nModules in Synthea are stored in the src/main/resources/modules folder under the base synthea directory. Submodules are stored in further subfolders under this. If your new or modified module is a top-level module and is expected to run for all patients starting at birth, make sure it is in the src/main/resources/modules folder. If you are modifying an existing module, make sure the name is exactly the same (in terms of capitalization, spaces vs underscores, etc) and you completely replace the file in its original location.\nOnce your module has been loaded, no special command line flags are necessary. Simply re-run Synthea with your desired configuration and it should pick up the new module immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon Issues / Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI created a module with just a Condition/Observation/Procedure but it doesn’t show up in records. Why not?\n\nMost likely the issue is that the state is being processed and the record entry is added immediately at birth, but then filtered out at export time. By default Synthea only keeps the last 10 years of history when a patient is exported. This setting is driven by the configuration item exporter.years_of_history. This setting can be changed either on the command line with flag --exporter.years_of_history=N or if using the developer setup, in the configuration file at src/main/resources/synthea.properties. We recommend setting this option to 0, meaning “keep all history”, while creating and debugging a new module.\n\nWhy isn’t Synthea processing my module?\n\nFirst, make sure you are not encountering the same issue as the previous question, where your module is being processed but the record entries are filtered out. Next, make sure the module is actually being loaded - watch the list of modules being loaded at startup and confirm your new module is in that list. It may be useful to temporarily remove other modules to speed up the process.\n\nHow can I run only my module and none of the default modules?\n\nGenerally this is not recommended as there are dependencies between modules which may be non-obvious and removing some can result in unexpected behavior, errors, or crashes. Also note that some of the modules are included as part of the core engine and cannot be easily disabled. However if for debugging purposes you would like to disable the default modules, the best approach is to remove the files from src/main/resources/modules (or move them somewhere else).\n\n\nIf your module still does not work as expected, please feel free to post a discussion item on the Synthea GitHub to request assistance. Make sure to include as much information as possible, including the module and any errors you are seeing."

    "section": "2 Keep Modules",
    "text": "2 Keep Modules\nIt is common in many use cases that only records with specific attributes are relevant, for example, maybe you only want records containing a certain diagnosed Condition. There are a few approaches that can be taken here:\n\nPost-process the data with another tool such as a Python script, to examine a set of exported records and filter out those that do not meet your defined criteria. (Note that if the condition of interest is rare, it may take a lot of time and resources to generate sufficient records)\nModify the module for your condition of interest, to ensure all patients get the condition. (Note this may be trivial in some instances, but in others the relationships between modules can be complex, or the item of interest may be set within the Java engine.)\nUse a Keep Module. A Keep Module is a module similar to a disease module, that defines criteria for whether a record should be kept or discarded. The biggest advantage of a Keep Module is that all patients exported will have the desired criteria, and it will generate the requested number of patients. (That is, assuming the criteria are possible to meet.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is critical that the Keep Module represent logic that it is possible for a Synthea record to actually meet. For instance, the Diabetes module will never onset diabetes in a patient earlier than age 18, so a Keep Module for “keep patients under 18 with Diabetes” will not work.\nSynthea does not have the ability to recognize when a Keep Module is impossible to satisfy. In these situations, to avoid running forever, the simulation will stop after a certain number of failed attempts to generate a record. If the situation is known to be possible but exceptionally rare, it is possible to increase the number of failed attempts before the simulation stops, with the config setting: generate.max_attempts_to_keep_patient = 1000\n\n\nThe basic idea of a Keep Module is that it is a regular Synthea module, built with the Module Builder, with a specially named Terminal state “Keep”. The module should use conditional transitions with logic such as “Active Condition” to determine whether to send patients to the Keep state or not. Patients that end the module in the Keep state will be exported, patients that end the module in any other state will be discarded and Synthea will restart a new patient with the same demographics but a different seed.\n\nConstruct a Keep Module using the Module Builder as usual (see instruction above in Creating and Editing Modules ), but do not save the .json file to the src/main/resources/modules folder. The easiest place to store it is in the base synthea folder.\nFinally to actually run Synthea with the Keep Module, use the -k flag with the path to the file, for example:\nrun_synthea -k must_have_diabetes.json\nNow patients exported to any output format will only be patients matching the defined criteria from the Keep Module.\nNote that only one Keep Module may be used at a time, however the logic within it can be as complex as you need.\nMore information on Keep Modules is available on the Synthea wiki."

A set of demographics files and other geographical information is available for many countries at the synthea-international repository.\nBeyond just other countries, the same approach can be use to create demographics files representing any population of interest. For research purposes, the most common changes are likely to be to the demographics of the desired population.\nFor instance, a research effort may want patients with a particular age and racial distribution. One potential approach to generate such a population in Synthea is to identify a city or state with the desired characteristics and generate a population in that location. Alternatively, or if there is no such city or state, one could create or modify the demographics file so that it contains a line for a location with he desired characteristics. The default demographics file is available at ./src/main/resources/geography/demographics.csv - this file may be modified directly, or you may point Synthea at an alternative demographics file with the configuration property generate.demographics.default_file. Details on the demographics file format are available on the Synthea wiki.\nOther types of information which can be modified or replaced to meet various needs are zip codes, time zones, providers, names, and costs.\nFull details for customizing Synthea to generate other areas are available on the Synthea wiki."

    "text": "5 Flexporter\nThe Flexible Exporter, aka “Flexporter” is an experimental feature that allows for arbitrary customizations in Synthea.\nThe Flexporter works using a YAML-based mapping file to define transformations that are applied to each patient record that is exported. Transformations generally contain a location, represented in FHIRPath, and a value to put at that location.\nAs with other customization features built into Synthea, the Flexporter is intended to tweak Synthea data, not radically transform it. Common situations where the Flexporter will be most valuable are situations where specific fields or resource types are needed but not exported. (For instance, imagine a use case that requires an Appointment resource prior to every Encounter. Synthea out of the box supports Encounter resources but not Appointment.) The Flexporter is intended to support a number of different use cases, but since it is impossible to predict every possible use case in advance, there are things that are outside the capability of the Flexporter.\nAs of April 2023, the Flexporter supports the following types of actions:\n\napply_profiles: Adds a given profile URI to the meta.profile field on resources matching the given FHIRPath\nset_values: Set values on fields on resources that already exist within the Bundle\ncreate_resource: Create new resources with specific values and add them to the Bundle.\nkeep_resources: Keep only resources matching certain FHIRPath. Other resources will be filtered out\ndelete_resources: Delete resources matching certain FHIRPath.\nexecute_script: Execute arbitrary JavaScript against either the entire Bundle or against individual resources of specific types. Note that the provided JavaScript may be arbitrarily complex, but loading libraries such as from npm is not supported.\n\nSample Flexporter Mapping File:\n---\n# name is just a friendly name for this mapping\nname: Random Testing\n\n# applicability determines whether this mapping applies to a given patient record\napplicability: true\n\nactions:\n - name: Set Immunization.recorded = Immunization.occurrenceDateTime\n   set_values:\n     - applicability: Immunization\n       fields:\n         - location: Immunization.recorded\n           value: $getField([Immunization.occurrence])\n\n\n - name: Create ServiceRequest for every Procedure\n   create_resource:\n     - resourceType: ServiceRequest\n       based_on:\n         resource: Procedure\n       fields:\n         - location: ServiceRequest.intent\n           value: plan\n         - location: ServiceRequest.encounter.reference\n           value: $getField([Procedure.encounter.reference])\n         - location: ServiceRequest.subject.reference\n           value: $findRef([Patient])\n         - location: ServiceRequest.code\n           value: $getField([Procedure.code])\n\n       writeback:\n         - location: Procedure.basedOn.reference\n           value: $setRef([ServiceRequest])\nThis example mapping does the following:\n\nFor every instance of Immunization:\n\n\nCopy the value from Immunization.occurrence[x] (note as of April 2023 in Synthea this will always be a dateTime) into the field Immunization.recorded\n\n\nFor every instance of Procedure:\n\n\nCreate a new instance of ServiceRequest and add it to the Bundle.\nSet the following values on the created ServiceRequest:\n\nSet ServiceRequest.intent to the fixed value “plan”\nCopy the value from the source Procedure.encounter.reference into the field ServiceRequest.encounter.reference\nFind the first resource matching Patient in the Bundle, create a reference to it, and set that on the field ServiceRequest.subject.reference\nCopy the value from the source Procedure.code into the field ServiceRequest.code\n\nSet the following values on the source Procedure:\n\nCreate a reference to the created ServiceRequest and set that on the field Procedure.basedOn.reference\n\n\nBecause the Flexporter is still experimental, to use it you must be working off the flexporter branch of the Synthea repository.\nTo run Synthea with Flexporter mappings enabled, use the -fm flag to specify a path to a mapping file. Multiple Flexporter mappings may be used at the same time, in which case they will be applied in the order listed in the command, for example:\nrun_synthea -fm ./src/test/resources/flexporter/qicore_common.yaml -fm additional_fields.yaml`\nFull detail on the mapping file specification and using the Flexporter is available on the Synthea wiki"

Using these demographics, Synthea randomly creates individuals with realistic race, sex, target age, etc., for the region.\nSynthea simulates each individual independently from birth until their death or the current day. As each individual lives out their synthetic life, they flow through disease modules that represent the progression and treatment of various diseases. Disease modules are built from publicly available incidence and prevalence statistics, along with care guidelines from medical institutions. No real person’s data is ever used to create a Synthea module.\nOnce the simulation is complete, the patient record is exported into industry-standard formats such as FHIR, C-CDA, CSV, or plain text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample synthetic FHIR R4 Patient\n\n\n\n\n\n{\n  \"resourceType\": \"Patient\",\n  \"id\": \"2497ee24-c7c3-5d9a-3425-85da2e9e8b23\",\n  \"meta\": {\n    \"profile\": [ \"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-patient\" ]\n  },\n  \"text\": {\n    \"status\": \"generated\",\n    \"div\": \"&lt;div xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\\\"&gt;Generated by &lt;a href=\\\"https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea\\\"&gt;Synthea&lt;/a&gt;.Version identifier: v3.1.0-354-g3a6a93487\\n .

    "text": "2 Generic Modules\nAt Synthea’s core is a set of disease modules, representing the progression and treatment of various conditions. Below is a small snippet of the Appendicitis module.\n\nDisease modules are state transition machines where each individual flows through the modules based on logical conditions and weighted randomness.\nEvery synthetic patient starts in each module’s Initial state at birth and immediately begins progressing through the module’s states. Each state represents a spot where something happens. There are two broad categories of states: control states, which drive the flow of a patient through the module, for example:\n\nDelay: Wait a certain amount of time before progressing, commonly used to represent how the risk of certain conditions changes with age.\nGuard: Wait until given criteria become true before progressing.\n\nAnd clinical states, which add entries to a patient’s health record, for example:\n\nConditionOnset: Represent the spot where the patient acquires a given condition, not necessarily where it is diagnosed.\nProcedure: Represent the point in time in a healthcare encounter that a procedure is performed.\n\nFor a full list of state types, see the Synthea wiki.\nEach state has a transition, which points to the state the patient will progress to next:\n\nDirect transitions: Point to a single state.\nDistributed transitions: Point to multiple states, each with a weighted probability. A patient progresses to a randomly chosen state.\nConditional transitions: Include logical rules showing which path to follow.\nComplex transitions: Are a combination of conditional and distributed transitions.\n\nModules will run until either the simulation ends (at patient death or when it reaches the current date) or until the module reaches a Terminal state.2\nCombining these simple concepts allows module developers to build robust and detailed models of disease progression and treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on Synthea clinical detail\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause Synthea is open source and accepts contributions from a global user base, the level of detail varies across modules. For instance, the Appendicitis module was the first to be created, and the level of detail is minimal. On the other hand, the COVID-19 module and submodules were designed to replicate the disease’s progression as closely as possible, and is probably the largest and most detailed module.\nFurther, the number of disease modules is limited. Early efforts focused on the “top ten” causes of premature death and reasons people see their primary care provider. Further additions have added a large number of modules representing common conditions, but rarer and more complex conditions may not be represented.\nThe Synthea community encourages and welcomes users to create new modules representing conditions of interest or to improve the detail and realism of existing modules.\n\n\n\nYou can view, modify, and create Synthea modules with no programming experience using the Synthea Module Builder. For more information, read Customizing Synthea ). There is also a short video introduction to the Module Builder, and a tutorial on the Synthea Wiki."

If you require fields that Synthea doesn’t populate, you can customize Synthea to add those fields. Read Customizing Synthea for more information.\nBy default, Synthea exports one file per patient, as a Bundle with type: transaction. This Bundle contains a single Patient resource as the first entry, followed by other patient-specific resources such as Conditions, Observations, Procedures, etc, roughly grouped by Encounter in chronological order. Synthea exports Organizations and Practitioners separately since these resources may be referenced by multiple patients’ resources. Synthea may also be configured to export FHIR Bulk Data.\nAs of April 2023, Synthea can produce the following resource types:\n\nAllergyIntolerance\nBundle\nCarePlan\nCareTeam\nClaim\nCondition\nCoverage\nDevice\nDiagnosticReport\nDocumentReference\nEncounter\nExplanationOfBenefit\nGoal\nImagingStudy\nImmunization\nLocation\nMedication\nMedicationRequest\nMedicationAdministration\nObservation\nOrganization\nPatient\nPractitioner\nPractitionerRole\nProcedure\nProvenance\n\nNote that not all patient records will contain instances of every resource type, and certain resource types will only be produced if certain settings are enabled.

The last argument that does not start with a hyphen is selected as the city within the selected state to generate the popualtion for.\nThe most common command line arguments are:\nrun_synthea [options] [state [city]]\n[-p populationSize] (number of living patients to produce)\n[-a minAge-MaxAge] (age range of patients to export)\n[-g gender]\n[-s seed] (for randomness / reproducibility -- runs with the same seed should produce the same results)\n[-h] (print usage)\n[--config=option ...] (any configuration option, see \"Configuration Options\" below)\n\nExamples:\nrun_synthea Massachusetts\nrun_synthea Alaska Juneau\nrun_synthea -s 12345\nrun_synthea -p 1000\nrun_synthea -s 987 Washington Seattle\nrun_synthea -s 21 -p 100 Utah \"Salt Lake City\"\nrun_synthea -g M -a 60-65\nrun_synthea -p 10 --exporter.fhir.export=true\nrun_synthea --exporter.baseDirectory=\"./output_tx/\" Texas\nNote: these examples use run_synthea for brevity. If using the Basic setup, use java -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar instead.\nAnnotated Example:\nrun_synthea -s 21 -p 100 Utah \"Salt Lake City\"\n\n-s 21 means “seed the random number generator with the number 21”. Runs with the same seed will generate the same population.\n-p 100 means “generate 100 living patients”. (Note the total generated population may exceed 100 if patients die during the simulation before reaching the present day.)\nUtah means generate patients only within the state of Utah.\n\"Salt Lake City\" means generate patients only within Salt Lake City. (Quotes are necessary when command line arguments contain spaces, apostrophes, or other special characters.)\n\n\n\n4.2 Configuration Options\nMany features can be configured using a properties file. The properties file syntax is one setting per line, with format key = value. Some of the most commonly modified settings are shown below.\n\n# Set the folder where exported records will be created.\n# Each export type (e.g., FHIR, CCDA, CSV) will be a subfolder under this:\nexporter.baseDirectory = ./output/\n\n# Set to true to enable the FHIR R4 exporter:\nexporter.fhir.export = true\n\n# Set the number of years of active history to keep from each patient. Default: 10\n# Set to 0 to keep all history from every patient, note this will increase file size significantly.\nexporter.years_of_history = 10\n\n# Set this to only include selected resource types: (e.g. Patient,Condition,Encounter)\nexporter.fhir.included_resources =\n# Set this to exclude certain resource types from export: (e.g. Observation)\nexporter.fhir.excluded_resources =\n\n# Set to false to enable adding numbers to synthetic patient names, to make it more obvious they are not real data.\ngenerate.append_numbers_to_person_names = true\nSynthea includes a default configuration file (if using the Developer setup, this file is at ./src/main/resources/synthea.properties). Each default setting can be individually overridden using a local settings file that is passed to Synthea when it is run with the -c flag:\njava -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar -c path/to/settings/file\nAlternatively, individual configuration settings may be modified by a command-line flag. Any command-line argument starting with -- will set the value of a configuration setting, for example:\njava -jar synthea-with-dependencies.jar --generate.append_numbers_to_person_names=false\n(note that when using this approach there should be no spaces between the setting name, equals sign, and setting value)\nAdditional information on configuration options can be found on the Synthea wiki.\n\nYou should now feel comfortable with the basics of how to run Synthea to generate synthetic health records. The next section will describe some options for customizing the patients that Synthea produces."

As always, the best option depends on the specific use case.\nThis module describes the following options for hosting FHIR data:\nThe approaches listed in this module are intended to be the quickest and easiest options for setting up a FHIR server for testing and training. Other options do exist, and for production capabilities you may want something more robust, but the options here are the best way to get started fast. The options on this page often include a set of default patient data which can be used for basic testing, or you can load your own data created by Synthea."

    "title": "Standing up a FHIR Testing Server",
    "section": "1 Logica Sandbox",
    "text": "1 Logica Sandbox\nThe easiest option for hosting data is to use a cloud service - no installation is required on your local computer. The other benefits are that registration is free, a common instance can be shared between multiple people, and you do not have to worry about losing everything when you restart your computer.\nThe Logica FHIR Sandbox is a free service provided by Logica Health that allows the FHIR community to experiment with and develop FHIR applications. The Sandbox supports SMART-on-FHIR and includes a number of pre-installed apps. We recommend the Logica Sandbox as a good first step.\nThis option does have a few downsides however: you are dependent on the service staying online and providing appropriate security to make sure your data is accessible to you and only to you. Real health data and synthetic data containing alterations you want to keep private should never be uploaded to a Logica sandbox. Anything stored in a Logica sandbox should also have a local backup copy, just in case.\nThere are no published limits on the Logica Sandbox, in terms of number of Patients, number of Resources, physical size, or bandwidth usage, however we recommend keeping your population as small as possible - both in terms of number of patients and the total amount of data per patient - in order to ensure good performance. Timeouts may occur if you try to upload files larger than roughly 2 MB. If a timeout occurs while uploading a file, wait a few minutes for it to finish processing before trying again - the server will throw an error if you try to upload a second patient while one is already processing.\nSignup Steps\nTo create your own Logica Sandbox, first register at https://sandbox.logicahealth.org. You will need to provide an email address, where you will receive a confirmation email which you should click to activate your new account. Sign in using your email and password and accept the terms of use.\nNow you can create a new sandbox by clicking the New Sandbox button. The creation screen is shown below.\n\nChoose a name, ID, and FHIR version that are appropriate for your usage. We recommend enabling the “Allow Open FHIR Endpoint” setting as this will make it easier to load an initial set of data, and it may be disabled later for security.\nIf you plan to load patients for a specific use case, you may want to disable the “Import sample patients and practitioners” option to ensure only your selected patients are loaded. Feel free to select or deselect the sample applications option - it will have no impact on basic FHIR operations.\nAfter clicking create, it will take ~15 seconds to setup the instance. Once ready, click on the row to go to the dashboard for your server. Feel free to explore the various options and features available, however this guide will not touch on any of them. See the Logica Sandbox Confluence page and FAQs for additional information. For now visit the Settings tab to see your “Open FHIR Server URL” - this is the server base URL that should be used for loading patients in the Loading Synthea Patients section below.\nLater, once you have loaded all the patients you want, if you want to require security on the server, return to this Settings tab and click the pencil icon to edit, and uncheck “Allow Open FHIR Endpoint”."

    "title": "Standing up a FHIR Testing Server",
    "section": "2 Docker-based Options",
    "text": "2 Docker-based Options\nIf for any reason you do not wish to use a cloud-based service like a Logica Sandbox, Docker offers a relatively painless way to get a FHIR server running on your local computer. Any of these options may also be setup to run natively, but using Docker allows you to bypass a lot of the setup and configuration that would otherwise be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Docker?\n\n\n\n\n\nAt its most basic level, Docker is a tool that allows you to run packaged software. Packaging software to run on Docker allows it to be preconfigured, include any additional dependencies it may require, and run on nearly any hardware and operating system. This is in contrast to traditional software which needs to be built separately or even developed separately for Windows and Mac, may need separate libraries to be installed first, and may have a complex setup process. Docker is very commonly used for running servers.\nKey terms: - Images are the packaged software definition. Images are tagged with a version so that you can use either the latest available, or a specific other version if necessary. Images may be layered on top of one another in order to combine them into a single software package. - Containers are the running instances of images. A container can be thought of as a separate virtual computer that is running the image.\nDetailed technical documentation on Docker is available at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/.\n\n\n\nWhile Docker-based options generally require some configuration, especially when you want your test data to persist after you reboot, they can be setup quickly and do not require programming knowledge to get started. Each of these options can be installed either locally on your own computer if you will be the only person using it, or on a shared server for ease of access by multiple people. Your options may vary based on your organization’s security requirements. The following instructions are intended for a Windows-based or Mac-based local installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Data Persistence on Docker\n\n\n\nAssume that Docker-based options will not persist data unless they specifically state that they do by default or you specifically configure them to do so. For example if you shut down Docker or restart your computer any patients you had loaded will be gone the next time you start up the server. Please review all documentation before loading a lot of data to make sure you do not lose work. Generally it is not possible to configure a live running Docker container to enable persistence; they need to be started with the proper settings.\n\n\nIn order to use these options, you must first install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/. (Note that Docker Desktop is generally not free for organizations and professional use. There are free alternatives however they require more manual effort to get everything working. Setting up an alternative to Docker is outside the scope of this page.)\nOnce Docker is installed, launch Docker Desktop, and confirm it is running with the docker ps command on the command line. This command shows you the currently running Docker containers. If you have just installed Docker for the first time, this should print only a header row:\n$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                      COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS                 PORTS\n$\nGit is also required for several of the Docker-based options.\n\n2.1 Logica Sandbox Community Edition\nThis set of Docker images mirrors the public Logica Sandbox, but can be run locally. If you like the full suite of what Logica provides but either want higher performance or do not want to use a fully public Internet service, this is a good option.\nQuick Start Make sure Docker is running, then clone the project, change to the directory, and launch the services with the following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/logicahealth/sandbox-community-edition.git\ncd sandbox-community-edition\ndocker compose up\nLaunching the services will take a while the first time as it needs to download the Docker images. Wait until the logging output stops, then open the sandbox at http://sandbox:3001. From here the steps are identical to the steps for the cloud service steps listed above.\nFull instructions are available at https://github.com/logicahealth/sandbox-community-edition.\n\n\n2.2 HAPI\nHAPI is the FHIR server implementation that the Logica Sandbox uses under the covers. If all you want is a plain FHIR server to run queries against, without any of the bells and whistles, HAPI is a good option.\nTo quickly pull and run the HAPI FHIR server on port 8080, make sure Docker is running, and then run the following:\ndocker pull hapiproject/hapi:latest\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 hapiproject/hapi:latest\nWait until the logging output shows Started Application in ___ seconds and you will have a FHIR server running with a base URL of http://localhost:8080/fhir. There is also a web UI for a few actions such as listing and uploading resources at http://localhost:8080/.\nFor more detail on the HAPI FHIR docker image, see https://hub.docker.com/r/hapiproject/hapi.\n\n\n2.3 Other Docker Options\nIf you know that you intend to run research on a server that is not based on HAPI, it may be advantageous to run the same type of FHIR server locally to ensure the capabilities you need for your use case are supported. Details on particular servers is out of scope for this page, but a few links are provided below to Docker setup guides for other common FHIR server implementations.\nOther popular FHIR servers include:\n\nMicrosoft/Azure FHIR Server\nLinuxForHealth FHIR Server (formerly IBM)\nBlueHalo FHIR Server (formerly Asymmetrik)"

    "text": "4 Loading Synthea Data\nFinally, once your server is running, you can load your Synthea data into it. In this section we assume you are using the default Synthea settings: FHIR R4, Bundles are of type transaction, all resource types are exported, etc., since certain setting changes may affect how you load the data. It is completely fine if you ran Synthea multiple times and your output folder contains several runs all mixed together, but it can be difficult to separate them out if that is the case.\nWe recommend using the curl utility (which should be available by default on most computers, but if not it can be downloaded from https://curl.se/download.html), with the following arguments:\ncurl -d @FILE -H 'Content-Type: application/json' SERVER\nwhere:\nFILE is the path to a FHIR Bundle .json file\nSERVER is your FHIR server's base URL\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' sets the content type to JSON to ensure the server handles it correctly\nIf you strongly prefer a graphical tool, Insomnia, which allows you to invoke APIs such as FHIR endpoints, is a good choice. For uploading multiple files though, the snippets below which call curl in a loop are likely to be the easiest. If you have experience with other tools such as Postman, feel free to use those instead.\nThe key to loading Synthea patients is to ensure files are loaded in the following order, so that references to resources across files will work correctly. You should not see any error messages when loading files. Replace SERVER in the following examples with your FHIR server’s base URL.\nFirst, load all hospitalInformation*.json files. These contain the Organization resources that are referenced by Encounters in the patient data.\nfor file in hospitalInformation*.json\n  do curl -d @$file -H 'Content-Type: application/json' SERVER\ndone\nSecond, load all practitioner*.json files. These contain Practitioners and PractitionerRoles.\nfor file in practitioner*.json\n  do curl -d @$file -H 'Content-Type: application/json' SERVER\ndone\nFinally, load all individual patient files. All patient file names start with a capital letter, unlike the hospital and practioner files above, so we can use that to select just the files that were not already uploaded in the previous two steps.\nfor file in [A-Z]*.json\n  do curl -d @$file -H 'Content-Type: application/json' SERVER\ndone\nOnce all the data has been loaded onto your server, you can access it as any other FHIR server by making API calls to the various resource endpoints."

Data analysis in these environments typically requires tidy data:\nFHIR’s data format does not meet this definition of “tidy.” While instances of FHIR resources do typically map onto observational units, the data contained within instances of FHIR resources are not “flat” – instead, data are stored in nested data structures. In some cases, like Observation.component, there may even be multiple “observational units” inside of a single FHIR resource instance.\nFortunately, FHIR’s computable JSON or XML data format makes it possible to use software to convert FHIR data into a tabular format. This is can be done with custom code, or via existing purpose-build libraries.\nThere are purpose-built libraries for Python and R that facilitate FHIR-to-tabular conversion:\nA technical introduction to using these libraries with synthetic FHIR-format data is provided in Using Python and Using R. The approach described in these modules can typically be performed by an informaticist, analyst, or statistician who is familiar with one of these environments and has reviewed the content on this website."

For example, SAS can read JSON via the JSON engine and XML via this method. Stata can read JSON via a third-party library or using its integration with Python. Other approaches like using an ODBC driver may also work.\nHowever, it may be simpler to use Python or R to convert FHIR-formatted data to tabular, and then import this into your analysis tool of choice.

FHIR-PYrate does this by taking an element from the FHIR-formatted data like Patient.identifier[0].value and converting to an underscore-delimited column name like identifier_0_value. (Note that Patient.identifier has multiple values in the FHIR data, so there are multiple identifier_N_... columns in the DataFrame.)"

There are two ways to get a more concise DataFrame:\n\nUse the approach above to load all elements into a DataFrame, remove the unneeded columns, and rename the remaining columns as needed. The process_function capability in FHIR-PYrate allows you to integrate this approach into the bundles_to_dataframe() method call.\nUse FHIRPath to select specific elements and map them onto column names.\n\nThe second approach is typically more concise.

The element paths can typically be constructed by loading all elements into a DataFrame and then manually deriving the FHIRPaths from the column names, or by looking at the hierarchy resource pages in the FHIR specification (see Key FHIR Resources for more information on reading the FHIR specification)."

    "text": "3 Selecting specific columns\nUsually not every single value from a FHIR instance is needed for analysis. There are two ways to get a more concise data frame:\n\nUse the approach above to load all elements into a data frame, remove the unneeded columns, and rename the remaining columns as needed.\nUse XPath to select specific elements and map them onto column names.\n\nThe second approach is typically more concise. For example, to generate a DataFrame like this…\n\n\n\nid\ngender\ndate_of_birth\nmarital_status\n\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n…you could use the following code:\n\ntable_desc_patient &lt;- fhir_table_description(\n    resource = \"Patient\",\n    cols = c(\n        id = \"id\",\n        gender = \"gender\",\n        date_of_birth = \"birthDate\",\n        # Rather than having fhircrackr concatenate all `Patient.maritalStatus` values\n        # into one cell, you can select a specific value with XPath:\n        marital_status = \"maritalStatus/coding[1]/code\"\n    )\n)\n\ndf_patient &lt;- fhir_crack(bundles = patient_bundle, design = table_desc_patient, verbose=0)\n\ndf_patient %&gt;% head(5)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhile XPath expressions can be quite complex, thier use in fhircrackr is often straight-forward. Nested elements are separated with /, and elements with multiple sub-values are identified by [N] where N is an integer starting at 1.\nThere are two approaches to identifying element paths to construct XPath expressions:\n\nLook at the FHIR specification or the relevant FHIR Implementation Guide to determine the paths of available data elements. For example, the Patient page in the FHIR specification describes the elements and their hierarchy for instances of Patient.\nPrint out the raw data returned by the FHIR server. Fhircrackr uses XML-formatted data, and the following code will print out one of the instances of Patient requested above:\n\nxml2::xml_find_first(x = patient_bundle[[1]], xpath = \"./entry[1]/resource\") %&gt;%\n  paste0 %&gt;%\n  cat\n\n&lt;resource&gt;\n  &lt;Patient&gt;\n    &lt;id value=\"1\"/&gt;\n    &lt;meta&gt;\n      &lt;versionId value=\"1\"/&gt;\n

more complex expressions like the one to extract marital_status from Patient.maritalStatus.coding[0].code. You can use a tool like this XPath tester to help generate XPath expressions, though online tools such as these should not be used with real patient data. For more information on XPath, see this guide."

By default, fhircrackr will concatenate these into a single cell per row, delimited with ::: (this is configurable; use fhir_table_description(..., sep = ' | ', ...) to delimit with | instead).\nFhircrackr provides some tools to split up multiple values stored in the same cell into separate rows in a “long” data frame:\n\ntable_desc_patient &lt;- fhir_table_description(\n    resource = \"Patient\",\n\n    # Prefix values in cells with indices to facilitate handling cells that contain\n    # multiple values\n    brackets = c(\"[\", \"]\")\n)\n\ndf_patient_indexed &lt;- fhir_crack(bundles = patient_bundle, design = table_desc_patient, verbose = 0)\n\ndf_patient_identifiers &lt;- fhir_melt(\n    indexed_data_frame = df_patient_indexed,\n    columns            = c(\"identifier.type.text\", \"identifier.value\"),\n   brackets           = c(\"[\", \"]\"),\n    sep                = \":::\",\n    all_columns        = FALSE\n)\n\ndf_patient_identifiers %&gt;% head(10)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe df_patient_identifiers data frame printed above has one row for each value of Patient.identifier for each instance of Patient.

For example, if you want to include the synthetic “Social Security Number” in the original data:\n\ndf_patient %&gt;%\n  # Add in row numbers for joining\n  mutate(\n    row_number = row_number()\n  ) %&gt;%\n  left_join(\n    df_patient_identifiers %&gt;%\n      # Note: this assumes there is just one social security number for each patient in the data.\n      # If this was not true, it would be necessary to remove extra data before joining so there\n      # was one row per patient.\n      filter(`identifier.type.text` == \"Social Security Number\") %&gt;%\n\n      rename(\n        \"ssn\" = \"identifier.value\"\n      ) %&gt;%\n\n      # Exclude the `identifier.type.text` column so it doesn't appear in the joined data frame\n      select(resource_identifier, ssn) %&gt;%\n\n      # Fhircrackr generates the `resource_identifier` column as a string, but it needs to be\n      # an integer for joining.\n      mutate(resource_identifier = as.integer(resource_identifier))\n    ,\n    by=c(\"row_number\" = \"resource_identifier\")\n  ) %&gt;% head(5)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nYou can see that the synthetic SSNs are now split out into a separate column."

    "text": "2 Common health-related code systems\nHealth data often contains codes from the following code systems:\n\nLOINC: Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes\nSNOMED CT: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms\nICD: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems\nRxNorm: Medical prescription Normalized\nCVX: Vaccine administered\n\nBelow are details about each of these code systems. Additionally, HIMSS provides a longer list of common code systems.\n\n2.1 LOINC\nLOINC identifies health measurements, observations, and documents. It often represents the “question” of an observation, with other standards representing the “answer” (such as SNOMED CT). The Regenstrief Institute, which maintains LOINC, calls it “the global lingua franca for identifying tests and observations.” (Regenstrief, n.d.a)\n\nStructure\nA LOINC code distinguishes a given observation (test ordered, survey question, or clinical document) across six dimensions known as Parts (Regenstrief, n.d.b). The table below defines each Part and provides an example using the LOINC concept a manual count of white blood cells in cerebral spinal fluid specimen with code 806-0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOINC Part\nDefinition\nExample\n\n\n\n\nComponent (Analyte)\nThe substance or entity being measured\nLeukocytes (white blood cells)\n\n\nProperty\nThe characteristic or attribute of the analyte\nNCnc (Number concentration)\n\n\nTime\nThe interval of time over which an observation was made\nPt (Point in time)\n\n\nSystem (Specimen)\nThe specimen or thing upon which the observation was made\nCSF (Cerebral spinal fluid)\n\n\nScale\nHow the observation value is quantified or expressed: quantitative, ordinal, nominal\nQn (Quantitative)\n\n\nMethod\n(Optional) A high-level classification of how the observation was made.

SNOMED CT is often the “answer” for a test or measurement (where LOINC would be the “question”). SNOMED International further details the utility of SNOMED CT as follows:\n\nSNOMED CT:\n\nIs the most comprehensive, multilingual clinical healthcare terminology in the world\nIs a resource with comprehensive, scientifically validated clinical content\nEnables consistent representation of clinical content in electronic health records\nIs mapped to other international standards\nIs in use in more than eighty countries\n\n\n\nStructure\nSNOMED CT is comprised of (International, n.d.):\n\nConcepts: Unique clinical meaning with a computer readable code. Can have multiple descriptions.\nDescriptions: Human readable explanation of a concept (what a doctor would read).\nRelationships: Correlation between related concepts, i.e., “synonyms.” Provides computer readable definitions of concepts and supports data searches.\nThere are two main types of relationships in SNOMED CT:\n\nHierarchical relationships establish each SNOMED CT concept as a child of a more general concept. Each concept in SNOMED CT has at least one hierarchical relationship. For example, 840533007 (SARS-CoV-2) has an is a relationship with its parent, 415360003 (SARS coronavirus), which in turn is a 868196001 (Subgenus Sarbecovirus).\nAttribute relationships define non-hierarchical relationships between two concepts. Concepts can have as many attribute relationships as needed. For example, 399150003 (PCR test for SARS) has a Component relationship with 415360003 (SARS coronavirus).3\n\n\nBelow is an example of how SNOMED might represent a condition (acute post-streptococcal glomerulenephritis) and its associated relationships:4\n\n\n\n\nflowchart BT\n    A{{SNOMED - CT Concept}}\n    B[Clinical Finding\\n404684003]\n    C[Body Structure\\n123037004]\n    D[Both Kidneys\\n17373004]\n    E[Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis\\n68544003]\n    F[Organism\\n410607006]\n    G[Beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, group A\\n413643004]\n\n    B --&gt; |is a|A\n    F --&gt; |is a|A\n    F --&gt; |is a|B\n    G --&gt; |is a|F\n    G --&gt; |Causative agent|E\n    E --&gt; |Finding site|D\n    D --&gt; |is a|C\n    C --&gt; |is a|B\n    C --&gt; |is a|A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 ICD-10\nICD is a medical classification list that contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases. The WHO, which publishes ICD, writes:\n\nClinical terms coded with ICD are the main basis for health recording and statistics on disease in primary, secondary and tertiary care, as well as on cause of death certificates. These data and statistics support payment systems, service planning, administration of quality and safety, and health services research. Diagnostic guidance linked to categories of ICD also standardizes data collection and enables large scale research.\n\nICD-10 is widely used and replaced ICD-9 in the US in the 2010s. ICD-11 is the latest version of ICD, with active use beginning in January 2022.\n\nStructure\nAn ICD-10 code can range between 3 and 7 alphanumeric characters and has three major parts (MedicalBillingandCoding 2023):\n\nCategory: A letter followed by two numbers, which describes the general type of injury or disease.\nSubclassification (optional): Up to three digits, further specifying an injury or disease. The subclassification follows the category after a decimal point. Each digit of the subclassification adds more specificity, explaining the cause, manifestation, location, severity, and type of injury or disease.\nExtension (optional): One of three letters describing the type of encounter for a given injury or disease: A (initial encounter), D (subsequent encounter), or S (sequila). The extension follows the subclassification.\n\nBelow is an example of different levels of specificity for an ICD-10 code (MedicalBillingandCoding 2023). The injury is a closed fracture of distal phalanx of right index finger.\n\nS62 – fracture at wrist and hand level\n\nS62.0 – fracture at navicular [scaphoid] bone of wrist\n…\nS62.5 – fracture of thumb\nS62.6 – fracture of other and unspecified finger(s)\n\nS62.60 – fracture of unspecified phalanx of finger\nS62.61 – displaced fracture of proximal phalanx of finger\n…\nS62.63 – displaced fracture of distal phalanx of finger\n\nS62.630 – displaced fracture of distal phalanx of right index finger\n\nS62.630A – … initial encounter for closed fracture\nS62.630B – … initial encounter for open fracture\nS62.630D – … initial encounter for fracture with routine healing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4 RxNorm\nThe NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces RxNorm and summarizes its purpose as follows:\n\nRxNorm provides normalized names for clinical drugs and links its names to many of the drug vocabularies commonly used in pharmacy management and drug interaction software… By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.\n\nIts scope includes the names of prescription and many over-the-counter drugs approved for use in the US, including generic and branded medications. RxNorm does not cover bulk powders, food, dietary supplements, and medical devices.\n\nStructure\nNLM completes the following three steps when classifying a drug (NIH, n.d.):\n\nGroup source data: When NLM receives drug names with different formats that refer to the same medication, it groups them all together and refers to them as synonyms. A group of synonyms is called a concept. Below are examples of synonyms that refer to the same concept:\n\nNaproxen Tab 250 MG\nNaproxen 250mg tablet (product)\nNAPROXEN@250 mg@ORAL@TABLET\nNaproxen 250 MILLIGRAM In 1 TABLET ORAL TABLET\nNAPROXEN 250MG TAB,UD [VA Product]\n\nCreate a normalized name for a concept: After grouping synonyms into a concept, RxNorm creates a normalized name with the ingredient, strength, and dose form. The name also includes if the drug is branded or in a pack. For the concept above, the RxNorm normalized name is “Naproxen 250 MG Oral Tablet.” The branded version is “Naproxen 250 MG Oral Tablet [Prosaid].”\nThe general format for an RxNorm normalized name depends on two factors: (1) generic vs. branded, and (2) single vs. pack. Below summarizes the general formats for each scenario:\n\nGeneric drugs: Ingredient Strength Dose Form\nBranded drugs: Ingredient Strength Dose Form [Brand Name]\nGeneric drug packs: {# (Ingredient Strength Dose Form) / # (Ingredient Strength Dose Form)} Pack\nBranded drug packs: {# (Ingredient Strength Dose Form) / # (Ingredient Strength Dose Form)} Pack [Brand Name]\n\nAssign a concept unique identifier (RXCUI): The RXCUI is a numeric identifier that is a code assigned to a given concept. For example, the RXCUI for the above concept example is 198013.\n\nRxNorm normalized names have different levels of specificity, defined by the term type (TTY). For example, depending on the TTY, an RxNorm normalized name might only include the ingredient, might only include the dose form, or one of many combinations of descriptors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to view the different TTYs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTY\nName\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nIN\nIngredient\nA compound or moiety that gives the drug its distinctive clinical properties.

Each vaccine also has a short description, a full name, and a status (e.g., Active or Inactive).\nCVX codes are also mapped into groups by disease targeted, and to vaccine manufacturers."

    "text": "3 Terminology in FHIR\nThere are three key FHIR resources for terminology:\n\nCodeSystem resource: Describes a code system, its concepts, and the codes identifying the concepts. E.g., the LOINC code system.\nValueSet resource: Specifies a specific set of codes from code system(s). E.g., LOINC concepts identifying types of cancer staging systems.\nConceptMap resource: Identifies relationships between sets of concepts. E.g., Mapping from SNOMED CT to ICD-10\n\nWe review these resources in detail below.\n\n3.1 CodeSystem resource details\nThe CodeSystem FHIR resource defines an organized, managed collection of concepts that belong to a given terminology system. The CodeSystem resource represents properties of standard terminologies (like LOINC and ICD-10) in a computable format. These properties include:\n\nThe canonical identifier for the code system (typically a URL like http://loinc.org for LOINC, or an OID like 2.16.840.1.113883.6.1 (which also represents LOINC)\nVersion\nThe concepts defined by the code system\nPublication metadata like a human-readable description, copyright information, and publication date\nProperties of the code system, such as concept permanence, case-sensitivity, and if it defines a compositional grammar.\n\nHere’s an example of a CodeSystem FHIR resource:\n{\n  \"resourceType\" : \"CodeSystem\",\n  \"id\" : \"example\",\n  \"meta\" : {\n    \"profile\" : [\"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/shareablecodesystem\"]\n  },\n  \"text\" : {\n    \"status\" : \"additional\",\n    \"div\" : \"...\"\n  },\n  \"url\" : \"http://hl7.org/fhir/CodeSystem/example\",\n  \"identifier\" : [{\n    \"system\" : \"urn:ietf:rfc:3986\",\n    \"value\" : \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.4.1827\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"system\" : \"http://acme.com/identifiers/codesystems\",\n    \"value\" : \"internal-cholesterol-inl\"\n  }],\n  \"version\" : \"5.0.0-cibuild\",\n  \"name\" : \"ACMECholCodesBlood\",\n  \"title\" : \"ACME Codes for Cholesterol in Serum/Plasma\",\n  \"status\" : \"draft\",\n  \"experimental\" : true,\n  \"date\" : \"2016-01-28\",\n  \"publisher\" : \"Acme Co\",\n  \"contact\" : [{\n    \"name\" : \"FHIR project team\",\n    \"telecom\" : [{\n      \"system\" : \"url\",\n      \"value\" : \"http://hl7.org/fhir\"\n    }]\n  }],\n  \"description\" : \"This is an example code system that includes all the ACME codes for serum/plasma cholesterol from v2.36.\",\n  \"caseSensitive\" : true,\n  \"content\" : \"complete\",\n  \"filter\" : [{\n    \"code\" : \"acme-plasma\",\n    \"description\" : \"An internal filter used to select codes that are only used with plasma\",\n    \"operator\" : [\"=\"],\n    \"value\" : \"the value of this filter is either 'true' or 'false'\"\n  }],\n  \"concept\" : [{\n    \"code\" : \"chol-mmol\",\n    \"display\" : \"SChol (mmol/L)\",\n    \"definition\" : \"Serum Cholesterol, in mmol/L\",\n    \"designation\" : [{\n      \"use\" : {\n        \"system\" : \"http://acme.com/config/fhir/codesystems/internal\",\n        \"code\" : \"internal-label\"\n      },\n      \"value\" : \"From ACME POC Testing\"\n    }]\n  },\n  {\n    \"code\" : \"chol-mass\",\n    \"display\" : \"SChol (mg/L)\",\n    \"definition\" : \"Serum Cholesterol, in mg/L\",\n    \"designation\" : [{\n      \"use\" : {\n        \"system\" : \"http://acme.com/config/fhir/codesystems/internal\",\n        \"code\" : \"internal-label\"\n      },\n      \"value\" : \"From Paragon Labs\"\n    }]\n  },\n  {\n    \"code\" : \"chol\",\n    \"display\" : \"SChol\",\n    \"definition\" : \"Serum Cholesterol\",\n    \"designation\" : [{\n      \"use\" : {\n        \"system\" : \"http://acme.com/config/fhir/codesystems/internal\",\n        \"code\" : \"internal-label\"\n      },\n      \"value\" : \"Obdurate Labs uses this with both kinds of units...\"\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n\nResearch applications\nPotential research applications include:\n\nIdentifying which code system a given code comes from.\nLooking up the concept definition or other metadata associated with a given code.\nUsing concept relationship metadata to reason about or filter data.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 ValueSet resource details\nThe ValueSet FHIR resource “specifies a set of codes drawn from one or more code systems, intended for use in a particular context.” ValueSets don’t refer directly to CodeSystems; rather, they identify the relevant CodeSystem by its URI.\nHere’s an example of a ValueSet FHIR resource:\n{\n  \"resourceType\" : \"ValueSet\",\n  \"id\" : \"example-cpt-all\",\n  \"text\" : {\n    \"status\" : \"generated\",\n    \"div\" : \"...\"\n  },\n  \"url\" : \"http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/example-cpt-all\",\n  \"identifier\" : [{\n    \"system\" : \"urn:ietf:rfc:3986\",\n    \"value\" : \"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.4.642.3.3138\"\n  }],\n  \"version\" : \"5.0.0-cibuild\",\n  \"name\" : \"AllCPTCodes\",\n  \"title\" : \"All CPT codes\",\n  \"status\" : \"active\",\n  \"experimental\" : true,\n  \"date\" : \"2015-03-12\",\n  \"publisher\" : \"Health Level Seven International (Vocabulary)\",\n  \"description\" : \"A value set that includes all CPT codes\",\n  \"useContext\" : [{\n    \"code\" : {\n      \"system\" : \"http://example.org/fhir/CodeSystem/use-contexts\",\n      \"code\" : \"species\"\n    },\n    \"valueCodeableConcept\" : {\n      \"coding\" : [{\n        \"system\" : \"http://snomed.info/sct\",\n        \"code\" : \"337915000\",\n        \"display\" : \"Homo sapiens (organism)\"\n      }]\n    }\n  }],\n  \"jurisdiction\" : [{\n    \"coding\" : [{\n      \"system\" : \"urn:iso:std:iso:3166\",\n      \"code\" : \"US\"\n    }]\n  }],\n  \"copyright\" : \"CPT Copyright © 2014 American Medical Association.

This role may have some hands-on experience with FHIR and related technology, but likely does not have comprehensive knowledge of the space. This role differs from the “Informaticist” in that it focuses on creating software, rather than on data modeling and manipulation.\nClinician Scientist/Trainee A role for practicing clinicians or clinician-trainees. This role is involved with research as a clinical subject matter expert or co-investigator, but is not be responsible for an entire study (or they would be in the “Investigator” role). Their role in research is focused on the clinical aspects related to their area of expertise, and could involve activities like chart review, creating a “phenotyping strategy” to identify a condition using EHR data, or designing a patient- or provider-facing intervention.\nTrainer This role is responsible for leading future CTR-led trainings. People in this role are likely hands-on technical, or technical leaders. There may be overlap with the “Informaticist” and “Software Engineer” roles."

If you can’t easily answer the question, then remove the sentence or move it to a new paragraph.\n\nEach sentence has a unique purpose.\n\nWhat is this sentence telling you? If it’s the same thing as a previous sentence, consider removing.\nExceptions are when the repetition:\n\nis intentional to solidify understanding\nprovides a new perspective\n\n\nEach sentence or phrase is meaningful.\n\nDoes the meaning of the paragraph change if you remove the sentence or phrase? If not, remove.\nExample “At its most basic definition, terminology in IT refers to a code mapping to a concept.”\n\nYou can remove “At its most basic definition” without losing meaning.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck each sentence for the following:\n\nEach word has a unique purpose.\n\nIf you remove the word, does the meaning of the sentence change? If not, remove the word.\nExample “These meet virtually on a weekly basis for a conference call.”\n\nvirtually and conference call are redundant: only one is necessary.\n\n\n“Very” and “really” are absent.\n\nCtrl-f for “very” and “really”. Remove these words.\nIf necessary, replace the verb or adjective with a more description verb or adjective.\n\nExamples “It’s really good.”\n\n“It’s excellent.”\n\n\n\nAdverbs are rare. Use them only when you can’t replace them with a more descriptive verb.\n\nCtrl-f for “ly”. For each adverb you find:\n\nDoes the meaning of the sentence change if you remove the adverb? If not, remove.\nCan you replace the modified verb with a more descriptive verb and remove the adverb? Use a thesaurus for this. If so, replace the verb and remove the adverb.\nIf you can’t remove or replace the adverb, keep it.\n\nExample “developing multiple Resources specifically for that purpose.”\n\nspecifically is unnecessary.\n\nExample “There is only one hierarchical relationship attribute.”\n\nonly is redundant to one.\n\nExample “She ran quickly”\n\n“She sprinted”\n\nExample “Adverbs and adjectives appear infrequently.”\n\n“Adverbs and adjectives are rare.”\n\n\nNominalizations are rare. (Nominalizations are verbs that have become nouns. They often end in “ion” or “ing”)\n\nCtrl-f for “ion” or “ing”. Does this word have a verb as a root? If so, can you replace the verb/“ion”-word combination with the root verb?\nExample “The sentence provides an explanation.”\n\nexplanation is a nominalization of to explain. You can rewrite this sentence as “The sentence explains.”\n\nExample “Her understanding of the situation meant that they could proceed.”\n\nunderstanding is a nominalization of to understand. You can rewrite this sentence as “Because she understood the situation, they could proceed.”\n\n\nSentences are simple, as long as simplicity doesn’t reduce readability.\n\nLook for sentences with 2 or more commas (where the commas aren’t part of a list).\nDoes the sentence have multiple purposes? If so, try dividing it into two separate sentences.\n\nExample “After they went to the park, they drove to a restaurant, and at the restaurant, they had dinner.”\n\nThe sentence says what they did after the park, and what they did at the restaurant.\n“After they went to the park, they drove to a restaurant. At the restaurant, they had dinner.”\n\n\nCan you reorganize or rewrite the sentence to use fewer commas?\n\nExample “In many cases, the reverse mappings are valid, but this cannot be assumed to be the case.”\n\n“Reverse mappings are sometimes valid, but not always.”\nor just “Reverse mappings may not be valid.”\n\nExample “Using standard terminology should be a simple and logical step in health IT. However, with the complexities of many diagnoses systems, clinical narrative transferred via PDF format, various coding systems, and the cost of digitizing volumes of reference material/dictionaries, it isn’t as easy as you would think.”\n\n“Using standard terminology is more difficult than expected given:\n\nthe complexities of many diagnoses systems,\nclinical narrative transferred via PDF format,\nvarious coding systems, and\nthe cost of digitizing volumes of reference material/dictionaries”\n\n\n\nIs the concept split into two parts with something in the middle? If so, move whatever is in the middle at the beginning or end.\n\nExample “Her dog, who was so cute, chased the ball.”\n\n“who was so cute” divides “Her dog chased the ball” in half.\n“Her adorable dog chased the ball.” is better.\n\n\n\nYou avoid jargon\n\nExample “Note in the first row that Patient also has a type, which gives inheritence of additional attributes we’ll discuss below.”\n\ninheritance is a software development concept that likely won’t be easily understood by people who aren’t already familiar with HL7 data types or software development.\nInstead, define inheritance inline or use a different word.\n\n\nYou use plain language. You use simpler words where the simple word has the same meaning.\n\nExample Try words like “use” instead of “utilize,” “about” instead of “approximately” and “try” instead of “attempt.”\nExample\n\nOriginal: “It is suggested that the wire should be connected to the terminal by the engineer when the switch-box assembly is completed.”\nSimplified: “We suggest that you connect the wire to the terminal when you finish assembling the switch-box.”"

While the basics of the FHIR specification are relatively straight-forward (see the Overviews: General, Developers, Clinical, and Architects), it can still be difficult to know where to start when implementing a solution based on FHIR.\n\n\n\nNote that this links to a specific version of FHIR (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4B/modules.html) as it is a direct quote.\nAlso note that the hyperlinks in the excerpt are maintained in the blockquote. The easiest way to accomplish this is to copy from the FHIR spec and directly paste into the .qmd file.\nWe will often refer to the “Resource Content”/“Profile Content” table for a FHIR resource or profile. This should be implemented as a single screenshot taken on a high DPI screen (like a MacBook screen) at 100% browser zoom for each table.\nScreenshots of profiles’ tables should include the tabs at the top to identify which view of the table is being displayed. The screenshot should be introduced with a link to the profile in question, like below.\nFor example, here is the differential from the Device Metric Observation Profile R4B:\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptions are not necessary for these screenshots. However, the images still need alt text and should link to the page where the screenshot was taken. Version-specific links should be used.\nThe same approach should be used for these tables in FHIR resources, though it is not necessary to include the tabs.\nHere’s a screenshot from the Observation resource as an example:\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the image hyperlink includes the #resource anchor to bring the reader directly to the “Resource Content” table in the documentation.\nIt is ok to only include part of these tables in the screenshot if that is beneficial. The example from Observation above is quite long, and it might be helpful to crop unnecessary parts. If you do this, you should do some lightweight image editing like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we do this frequently, we can look into standardizing how this is done for consistency."

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nThe FHIR Bulk Data specification uses SMART Backend Authorization to connect. The basic idea of SMART Backend Authorization is that registered clients make a signed request to a token endpoint to receive a Bearer token, which is then used for subsequent calls to the FHIR server.\nIn practice, client registration is likely to happen as a separate one-time event performed manually. The SMART Backend Auth specification does not define an API for registration.\nFor this workshop, we are connecting to the SMART Bulk Data Server which allows clients to “register” using either a JWKS URL or by raw JWKS. (“registration” in this case is not stored on the server, instead they provide a base URL where that “registration” is stored as state in the URL and clientID). For convenience, the SMART Bulk Data Server launch page allows users to generate a once-off JWKS to use for testing. For production usage, clients must generate their own certificates and JWKS and keep the private key private. In this workshop we use a JWKS generated by the launch page with algorithm “RS384”.\nIMPORTANT: this workshop largely skips error handling and stays on the “happy path” for brevity and readability. We strongly recommend reviewing the specifications and adding better error handling before using any of this code in a production environment.\n\n# The default style for rendering JSON (dictionaries) in Python isn't the best.\n# Use this import and call print(json) when we want a cleaner view.\n\nfrom rich import print"
